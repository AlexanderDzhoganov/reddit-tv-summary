After reading the good reviews here on season 2 I decided to give it a go and wow! Rarely do I feel shows get better with season 2 but this one definitely did. Two episodes in and I went back to give season 1 a re-watch and this time it had my full attention. Really loving this showing and it\u2019s fast becoming a favorite that I feel will be on rotation when there\u2019s nothing new to watch. The show has such a great rewatch value, they really are utilizing little details sprinkled around the episodes to pay it off by the time the finale rolls around.

The show nailed the balance between comedy and drama and was very satisfying despite hinting at some dark subject matter. The main cast was very good particularly the two leads Karen Gillan and Hugh Bonneville. I also liked the pacing of the show and how the plot developed in an unexpected but enthralling way.

Both Riley Keogh and Lily Gladstone were as good as expected from such great actresses but I think the young cast also deserve a lot of credit as they were fantastic in their roles. A real mix of naive, vulnerable, cruel, and charismatic in equal turns. Excellent crime show."

        "Netflix just dropped season two and its even better than season one. The first handful of episodes from S1 feel like Star Wars, which was absolutely intentional to hook young viewers. After that it got better and better and more Trek in all the best ways. Season two has a different feel in that there are far less standalone episodes but it is just as good if not better than season one. Its marketed to kids but its for everyone. Yes, there are things that are obviously targeted at children but if you're a fan of Trek, even if you're a scifi fan who has never watched Trek, you will enjoy this show. Long time Trek viewers will be rewarded with tie-ins to Next Generation, Voyager, Picard, Trek Shorts, and there's even a funny mention of the Cerritos. I don't think any of that is a spoiler, its an incentive. I liked the show from the start, but can see how it may take some time for it to click with others. But it's gotten progressively better as it's gone on. This season was on another level for me. I really hope it does well enough to get a season 3 because it deserves it. Plus the set-up for a potential new story is very interesting. But even if it doesn't, it's a hell of a journey with a very satisfying ending in its own way."

I actually have Deep ThoughtsTM about the reaction online to the older women who are running the show: the two coaches and managers and Charlotte Jones. I recently saw a TT where someone was excoriating them as horrible, awful, mean, terrible, but the only concrete example was the insistence that they be called \"ma'am.\" I dunno, I think this is sexism and internalized misogyny with a sprinkle of ageism, frankly. I didn't see these older women cursing, insulting, or otherwise treating these younger women with anything but stern respect and having very high standards. I strongly (strongly) suspect if these were men, we would have nothing to say except that they were \"geniuses\" like Steve Jobs types. They are exacting and focused Type A people, so what. One of them (Kelly I believe) is directly responsible for growing the DCC into a multi million dollar org. I don't want to hear what a \"bitch\" she is. She's a hard nosed business-person, sure. But this take really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure it's up to Charlotte Jones per se to decide on the DCC salaries (the other area the TT-er was going on about) and it is a part time entertaiment job that 1000s of women want. I can imagine it's very difficult to peg that market rate for that job."
