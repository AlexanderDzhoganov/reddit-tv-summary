The second or third to last episode is one of the best episodes in the last 10 years imo. Much of it is shot in one take or seamlessly portrayed as such."

Also, give Anthony Starr his emmy already or at the very least a nomination. Anthony Starr as Homelander is one of the all-time best villain performances I've ever seen. It's bone-chilling.

While season 4 is still good, it hasn't reached great status and has been kind of dragging. Homelander is still great as always but now it feels like he's the only character that has been good. S4 felt like 3 episodes in the middle of a season. Nothing has really happened to make it feel like this season things will be different. It just kind of continued on from the end of 3. Many characters seem to have lost the spark that made them tick, especially Starlight and MM. The only track that felt interesting and new was that of Butcher and Ryan.",

I hope S4 can freshen things up, although the first episode does not really indicate so. This season focus is on Homelander going \"evil\" in public and Neuman's bid for presidency. Everything about it is so high quality, but the plot has moved inches since season 1. Recycling the same core conflict season after season and hitting the reset button towards the end of each season. The pacing of these 3 episodes was brutal.",
        "The Homelander plot is entirely too derivative of the Trump playbook. It's painfully obvious Homelander is carrying this show which is why they won't kill him off. Hard to keep interest when you know there's plot armor everywhere. The Frenchie/Kimiko plots are utterly pointless and the rest of the boys flip flop against themselves and each other so often that their characters are already dead.

They are so much in love with their world building that it nearly feels smug how much they love to do give examples of how fucked up the world is, but it's mostly all just 1:1 shit that has actually happened IRL so it just feels lazy and outdated. Then they throw in some weird unnecessary gore or haha penis scene (sauna, ice skating rink) as if they need some edgy scene quota each episode, which just cheapens the whole thing. Like, what kind of show are you trying to be? Obviously it's been a while since the last season so I'm a bit rusty, but what the fuck is everyone's motivation even? So many players and everyone seems to have a different goal, and they all seem to change randomly. Then sure, why not give Frenchie and Mute Girl some NEW thing this last episode because we didn't have enough plot threads already. And Sage? Just comes out of nowhere and goes from not wanting to do anything with the whole complex to suddenly pulling the strings on it all for... reasons I guess. Someone else already pointed out how little Hughie has to do which is kind of funny. Whenever he shows up I'm like \"Oh yeah, that dude used to be the main character, no ?\" Also does Butcher's accent keep getting worse? Feels like a cheap parody at this point.",

Huey\u2019s and Frenchie\u2019s side stories are just so boring. And Sister Sage is way too annoying to be such a prevalent character. Although I do find it comical that some people weren\u2019t aware of the symbology until they beat them over the head with it this season. Shows the intelligence of some of these people. This season is wayyyyyyyy on the nose. Gotta be to make the right-wingers understand they are being criticized. It\u2019s an entertaining watch but solely because of Homelander and his antics. Everything else is meh and I feel like the plot has just been stale for a while now. I actually really like Sister Sage, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad character at all.",
        "The Boys season 4 so far is awful. Absolute trash. If this is a final season, I would have rather they ended it in season 3, because it is looking like a bad way to go, like many other shows that started good and ended shit. It\u2019s not the final season, the fifth one will be, though. They just announced that the other day. It\u2019s a time filler. It\u2019s not as deep as everyone is making it out to be. Some shows fizzle out, The Boys has been one of them but I\u2019ll still see it through. Noped out halfway through the 1st episode. It's the same thing again and again. Hughie's side plot might as well be written for \"days of our lives\" It's so bad. My main problem with the show is that I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re not killing each other. Character motivations are so off to me. Like why is sister Sage okay with being a villain?",

Is this just a few stupid people on Twitter who journalists then magnify and pretend represent some larger group?

It has nothing on the book version that's for sure. Also, Alicent in the show is a completely different character to the book. I despise the \"hypocritical\" route they took for her character. My view of Alicent was that she was someone who did everything that was expected of her and the tragedy of her character was that she could do pretty much everything right yet still end up sad, bitter and alone at the end. The show can no longer provide that ending for her now with the same impact as the book."

        "I'm honestly confused at the massive backlash to this. Yeah I dont get it I made the mistake of looking at reviews and deciding to not watch it.  Watched it anyways and have been enjoying it so far. It's mostly right wingers that don't like having a non white male lead or lesbian witches. It's a CW Star Wars show. Not necessarily a bad thing. But I think fans want something more. I do not recommend The Acolyte to any existing fans of Star Wars.  Disney keeps co-opting existing Star Wars cannon and making it in their own way which is essentially ruining it.  Some examples from The Acolyte: Anakin's immaculate conception is supposed to be special, but The Acolyte is playing it down like it's no big deal and the witches are the ones that birthed Anakin.  Anakin was created by the force because it sensed a major imbalance.  This usually happens once every generation or so, but the kids are not always discovered.  Since Sith are the ones that like to dominate the force, they are usually the ones that cause these imbalances.  The Jedi tend to live in harmony with the force. But where a LOT of fans (like me) are pissed off with The Acolyte is that they are stealing the story of Knights of the Old Republic.  This is something that fans have desperately wanted for decades.  The premise of KOTOR is that a Sith, called Darth Revan, gets captured by Jedi and they use the force to erase his memories and then they use him as a Jedi.  Eventually Darth Revan figures out what is done to him and that he's actually evil.  It's a really really awesome story.  Many of us strongly believe that this is the direction that Disney is going with The Acolyte.  If this is true, then Disney is essentially pulling the rug out from under our feet and taking this amazing story from us.",

        "If you like shitty scifi there's also Acolyte",
        "As the most diehard *Star Wars* fan on the planet, the first thing I can say about this show is that it is very intriguing; it feels very similar to *Andor* in that I was apprehensive about it, but as the episodes came out and the picture began to solidify, I can really appreciate a bit of the slow burn mystery surrounding Osha and Mae, and what the Jedi did 16 years ago. The entire production is very well made, you can definitely tell they were smart with their money because the sets are great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, etc; the only technical flaw I can think of is >!Torbin's horrible fake beard!< in Episode 2, but that's par for the course with fake beards in *Star Wars* lmao. On the whole everyone is trying really hard and putting in the effort here and it shows. I must say that as the biggest SW fan ever, I have to concede that others might not be interested in this show for whatever reason; I like this show because it's finally showing, in a good and proper way, the politics and follies of the Jedi Order and how they fell from grace by the time of the Prequels, which of course led to their own destruction. These Jedi are obviously flawed, but they're not as robotic and callous like they were in the Prequels, *but you can see the inklings of that developing*. The mystery that underpins the whole plot is directly and thematically tied to this idea, **but if you don't care about that you probably won't care about this show**. A bunch of ragebait culture war vids on Youtube say that Episode 3 has destroyed the Force or something, and that's just because >!two lesbian witches had twins using the Force to do IVF or something!<, which isn't new information in the lore because that's how some of the Nightsisters made kids, and other Force-Sensitive sects do exist in the galaxy. **People wanted to hate this show the minute it was announced**, and so unfortunately any criticisms I see tend to be entirely subjective and most of the time downright sexist/bigoted/hateful in general, just because the main characters are female PoC, as well as the director/creator being a woman too. People are also now complaining about there being fire in space, which has always been there in *Star Wars*; if you're looking at this show and **nitpicking everything that you never did with other parts of the franchise**, ***are you being critical or are you being biased against it?*** I'll try to provide some objective criticism here: I think that the show is relying heavily on a few tropes that maybe have gone out of fashion for a reason. The idea of a >!good and evil twin!< is tired. I also think that this show will probably benefit from rewatching, since the mystery and flashbacks still have to unfold, so these early episodes at this point are filled with questions, character decisions, and dialogue that may or may not be payoffs in the end, and we don't have all the information yet, so sometimes these decisions seem overly contrived for the story.",
        "Acolyte is doing some bold moves. I honestly thought (esp toy selling wise) the wookie would be more present in the show. But nope. I thought they would drag turning mae but looks like they are going in different direction, the biggest thing they could do is kill off a twin next bit I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that bold. Though it\u2019s kinda obvious we got some red shirts in the group atm. They are not surviving the fight in the next episode. I do need the show to unravel lore a bit more though. Like I am enjoying the characters but Star Wars is a \u2018give me pieces of lore to learn about\u2019 kinda universe imo. Next episode is going to be that point if they smartly reveal something or not",

It's the most beige, mediocre show I've seen in some time. It's not terrible, it's just not great and it's baffling it ran for so many seasons. \"A cop show for Dad's in their mid 50s\" is one review I saw and it kinda sums it up. Bosch is pretty much on point for the source material. It's a \"safe\"/junkfood cop drama with a good ensemble cast...like Law and Order but stretched out to a full season rather than episodic. Bosch is really a slow-burn show that's only interesting when you watch the entire season. There's a lot of \"filler\" time, which I think is really intentional since they have it through all seasons and in the spinoff. I watched Bosch S1 way back when it started and it was actually quite good. The pilot of Bosch and the man in the high castle was 2 of the 5 pilot up for voting by audiences then and those 2 got the most votes. I did like Bosch S1 and I came back for S2 however S2 bored me so much I stopped and never went back. I was so surprised it went on for so long."

        "They needed to get more different takes for the acting. The first two episodes were watchable but a little cringe at parts. Episode three was really bad and felt like a background story recap on top of that. Episode four was kind of good even though again, they needed to get better takes for line delivery. Episode four was also too short and is obviously half of a segment. They need to start shooting these like television series.",
        "It's not the most exciting show but it does have things I am interested in, such as the High Republic time period. It's nowhere near as strong as Andor or Mando, but it's also an unfinished series atm. It might be good once the entire story is out but for now it's just okay. But it does give me hope for >!Darth Bortles!<"

Have enjoyed most of the Castle as a private investigator episodes. Doing it that way brought back the competitive tension from before Castle and Beckett started dating. Even if it's just temporary, it made for some pretty great episodes. If the show lands the finale, I could see this being good for an occasional rewatch.",

        "Premise is great! Reminds me of The Vampire Accountant Fred (books) but the execution is SHYTE. The acting is so bad they could cast non-actors to do a better job. The best acting has come from Mike, Ashley, The jogger dude Reginald tried to eat in the park and at times Angela but most of the time she's a miss not a hit. The leads, Maurice, Sarah - their acting is subpar at best and cringe in general. There are a ton of filler nonsense scenes of utter unimportance and feels like the writers binge-watched every episode of VD and tried to be edgy and do the exact opposite. Pity, this could have been epic like WWDITS with a little cult following and memes for every occasion."

        "Final season of the series. I've been watching this since it started airing so sad to see it go. This season was overall pretty good. I liked seeing Sean and Lea navigate early parenting. I thought there struggles were realistic and the show handled there being drama there well without either character showing a lack of respect for the other or there ever being a moment where it looked like they would break up. The new characters introduced was a nice take but honestly I found Charlie to be obnoxious for the first half of the season. She was constantly causing issues by interrupting during medical emergencies and would refuse to listen to any criticism. Then suddenly halfway through the season it felt like she had a bit of a turnaround and everything was reconciled in a single episode then it was fine after that. Glassman taking in a drug addict drove me nuts and felt avoidable. By the end of the season I came around though and understood that it is more about him wanting to do something good and try to make amends for what happened to his daughter. Honestly I got the impression that the writers were told this was the final season halfway or 2/3 through the season because it felt like the season was setting up a lot of plotlines then quickly ramped up to wrapping up plotlines and resolving things right in the last few episodes. I thought the series finale was well done. I liked the time jump with Sean. Funny enough I think he committed a HIPA violation in his TED talk though by showing the names of every patient he has treated (unless he reached out to and got approval from every single one which I doubt). Anyway, good season and good show. Not always perfect but I think the drama about autism's representation in the series is overblown. Yes it doesn't represent all autistic people but no show could. I think it is a fair representation of what some people experience who are higher functioning."
