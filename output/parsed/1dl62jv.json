The showrunner is The Night Of's Steven Zaillian, who's pulling off both directing and writing every single episode. Netflix promoted it as a miniseries, but Zaillian's original plan was to attempt adapting all five of Patricia Highsmith's \"Tom Ripley\" novels. John Malkovich popped up with such a tiny role (that character becomes much more central in the second book).",

I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix.

It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it."

        "The TV Series: Aside from what everybody else has said about this weeks Interview with the Vampire, I have to say I've never seen a show play around with unreliable narration to this extent and actually pull it off. It's a fine line to walk between intriguing and gripping the audience, and frustrating the audience, making them lose investment in what's happening because none of it could be what actually happened, and so far the show has succeeded at the former. This episode in particular showed some of the most important scenes of season one through Lestat's POV and seeing just how different things went down compared to what we initially shown is just fascinating. Now we don't know if Lestat's recollection of events are what actually happened, but it is implied they are much closer to the truth than Louis' recollection, which has been so heavily tainted by emotions, time, his mental health and possibly having his memory modified by Armand. And showing that Louis is still hallucinating Lestat in Dubai shows that what we've been seeing of Dubai may not be as objective as the audience was lead to believe, which is rather intriguing. Yeah, with the implication that Armand has been fucking over Louis mind for years, I'm gonna go on a limb and say the only narrator we could really trust (and even then, to a certain extent) would be Lestat, if he ever gets to share his side of the story. Man, that show is fucking bonkers. And this is probably recency bias talking but I cant think of any other show where the entire cast is that perfect, with no exception and not a single false note since the beginning. This is one of the best write ups I have seen for this season. Thank you for making me think even harder. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc",
        "It is one of the best shows on television and I am consistently blown away by the acting on display. Sam Reid's Lestat is phenomenal but, honestly, so is the entire cast.",
        "Claudia has been absolutely astounding this season.",
        "It is dark and gory. Anne Rice wrote the series while drinking heavily after her young daughter died. So grief and tragedy are baked into it. The original novels inspired a lot of \"romantic vampire fiction\" over the past few decades. The series has a lot of blood and death as the vampire lead explores his new existence as an immortal who needs blood to survive and his relationship to humanity and the destruction he now causes. The show is a \"retelling\" of the original story where the interviewer is called back as an older man to be told the \"true story\" of events that took place from when he first became a vampire in the early 1900s to now.",
        "It's a lot better than it should be. Very enthralling and entertaining. Great job by the showrunners. Could have been many other (worse) things. I just finished season 1. It was a great watch. Very enthralling storytelling. Yes, there is gore and yes it deals with dark subject matter. It reminds me of True Blood but (so far) not as ridiculous or as over the top.",

Still, the fact that they managed to find relative unknowns that apparently just happen to be the biggest talents in the business, is nothing short of miracle.",

Two weeks ago it was Jacob Anderson and Assad Zaman, this week Sam Reid *crushes it* in his long-awaited return. Wow. Wow wow wow. This is the episode we all been waiting for and dreading, and it was as beautiful and soul crushing as expected. What I didn't expect was 1) how much Madeleine would make me sob, and 2) the grotesque horror of a different perspective on one of the pivotal scenes. That was bone-chilling and really drives home how *both* Lestat and Louis, but even more so Louis, are the doom of everyone around them. Yes, this is a love story, but one that brings destruction to themselves and others. And Claudia is their biggest victim. What a masterpiece. Season one was really good, but this season has been absolutely phenomenal. Easily the best show this year so far.",

While Game of Thrones was a story about an entire kingdom, with stories that were connected taking place all across Westeros, House of The Dragon is a palace intrigue show that mainly takes place inside a castle. It's the same characters in the same place each episode. It makes it feel more soap opera like. And it's probably a lot cheaper to film that way.",

S1 was often a bit confusing with the time jumps, half the characters with the same or nearly the same name, and so many of them with the distinct white hair making them harder to tell apart on top of the confusing name thing. I suspect it's a lot easier to track things on a rewatch though. Looks better this season so far.",

        "This week's episode is one of the best episodes of live action Star Wars ever, yet its IMDb rating is a 3.7 despite being out for just an hour. If you ever needed solid proof of the review bombing, this is it. Last episode I was ready to call it until the last minute of that episode, so gave it one more chance. What a wild episode, I am fully back in. Some fantastic chorography that was not your typical spin to win style lightsaber battles we grew up on. The antagonist, >!while predictable who they are!<, absolutely just upped the stakes. I look forward to where the story progresses from here. This show gets so much uncalled for hate. I really don't get why people expect high art out of Star Wars. It's good for what it is, which is basically a live action comic book aimed at young adults. Very much like The Mandalorian which people go nuts over. Seriously, god damn that was a sick ass half an hour. I thought it was genuinely one of the worst modern hours of SW ever, and that's saying something after some of the Obi-Wan and Boba Fett episodes. That said, I wouldn't be surprised at review bombing. There is a weird gender, LGBT thing cultural war going on in the US that I don't really understand as an Aussie. \"one of the best episodes of live action Star Wars ever.\" I highly doubt that the best episode from Acolyte is going to surpass any episode from Andor. And I hate to be that guy, but going by your comment history you have been defending Acolyte since EP 1. Such a good episode!! One of the best episodes is kind of stretching it for me, if you've watched Andor or even Mandalorian they're much better shows than The Acolyte. I think it's basically a CW Star Wars, but all power to you, although imo the IMDb rating is more than justified hahaha. And why are they review bombing this show in particular?",
        "This show's a bit all over the place. I find it endearing that it fully embraces the inherent ridiculousness of Star Wars. The Korean guy sucks really hard. Like he almost single-handedly manages to sink the whole production. That's power. Also, while I watched the latest episode this realization came upon me: Jedis (or Jedi) are assholes. Entitled, self-righteous assholes. Just saying. I was trying to think of a positive note to end this comment, but I just thought of more of the contrary. Like, the turning points/big reveals you can spot them a mile away.",
        "They killed off more characters than I expected in this episode. There were few unknown red shirts I knew would die but few established cast I thought had plot armour or Disney merch armour who died. The fight was good, choreography was good. So far definitely not up to andor quality but miles better than boba fett and mandolorian (that was fun but kinda lost itself) better then the prequels and much better than the last two sequel films. It\u2019s interesting for a show that\u2019s killing off so many characters that it keeps a flashy look. I wonder if this put some people off, it kinda has the \u2018fun\u2019 Star Wars look for what is a \u2018you\u2019re going to watch a lot of Jedi get murdered\u2019 show",

Only note is that in S2, the Michelle actress really needs to go back to acting school because in her very first appearance, her emoting very clearly visibly telegraphed the upcoming relationship plot twist with Judy. As a result I was very not surprised attest of the alls when they finally hooked up. The other supporting characters were great: Nick, Perez, the good-looking fella from Jury Duty; it's just that whoever directed Michelle didn't think to say, \"Hey, uh, dial back the male gaze a bit.\" Also, if you're a fan of Married with Children, there is a very surprising near-reunion to be had in the penultimate episode. 5/5, actually funny women to be found here."

Smart of the production crew to save money by reusing props I guess. Found it kind of odd towards the beginning of that episode where Sydney's dad is wearing his work shirt with his name on it while chilling at home offering his daughter a coffee and offers for her to \"live here forever\". Literally no one does this at all in the real world. Normal people tend to wait until right before they clock in before shrugging themselves into their work shirt, and normal people don't let their adult children keep living with them. But I guess the prop department REALLY NEEDED to let me know that Emmanuel's not only a hard-working blue collar man, but also sensitive too! Ostensibly idealistic and heart-warming, but ultimately damaging when impressionable viewers tries to apply this takeaway to the real world and have reality shit down their fucking necks. edit: Just saw the S3E4 synopsis saying that she's getting her own apartment so I guess my outlook was correct as always.

        "Tales of the Empire: 6 episode miniseries. Really enjoyed this one. Essentially it is broken down into two arcs. One about Morgan Elsbeth (who appears in Mandalorian and Ahsoka) and how she goes from Nightsister to working with Thrawn. Was a sad story about how one can turn from oppressed to oppressor. Only complaint is in the first episode an older woman who is in charge of a village tells the people not to worry about getting attacked and to trust her but gives no details. This is after genocide of the Nightsisters nearby. Since she provides no safety or ideas others start training for defense in secret which then backfires when the droids attack only to reveal that the old lady could defend and had a plan the whole time...then the show acts as if she was in the right and everyone else should have trusted her and were wrong to go against her. This was just like in the Last Jedi when Admiral Holdo refused to communicate with her team, everyone goes against her since she gives off that she has no plan, then it is revealed she had a plan all along and the show acts like everyone else was in the wrong for not trusting her.",
        "Tales of the Empire: The second arc follows Barriss Offee and follows up from Clone Wars where she was arrested for murder if I remember correctly? This one is a nice contrast as the arc is kind of opposite showing her redemption arc. However, at the end the show seems to show the Fourth Sister being redeemed which is hard to accept given her genocide of civilians earlier in the show. Would recommend.",
        "I loved this, episode I can't explain why but from beginning to the end Diego Luna's Character, Andy Serkis showed such range. The Senator's storyline is so good in it's little rebellious undercurrent and her family dynamics. Vel kind of annoys me, But I'm not too hung up on her character. Bix Caleen is a bit of an empty character but again I'm not hung up on her. \"What'shername\" - She's now in charge of Morlana Six and Ferrix, yeah her, she is so well executed by the actress I hate her, fear her, am inspired by her and kinda feel like she'll be a big reason why the Empire rises. Kyle Soller and his mother ... holy shit relatable. Andor shows what you can do when you are allowed to slow the pace down and develop characters and relationships and situations. When you do that, then the things that happen afterwards have so much more meaning and effect. Compare that to a lot of other SW and Marvel TV shows where it feels like they have a quota for action scenes and so the producer is there snapping their fingers saying \"hurry up hurry up\" for all the development scenes so that we can get to the action scenes. The effect is to make the action mean only a fraction of what it should because the audience doesn't have the same kind of emotional investment into the whole thing. So with Andor it builds up so much meaning and that makes the action payoff have far more value. Other SW shows fall into the trap of rushing us from scene to scene and then giving us so much action but without a good build up and so the payoff has little effect. Quality vs quantity. A very good prequel to a very good movie (Rogue One). Andor is the only Star Wars show I have liked."

The High Schoolers look like High Schoolers, not actors in their 20s. Most importantly, it does drama and comedy equally well. I tear up from laughing and from the sad/touching moments. The production quality is top notch and a lot of times I forget it's a television show and not a movie.
