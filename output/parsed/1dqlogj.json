        "Sometimes the tonal balancing act doesn't work but my god am I entertained, and these actors are so so good. A stand out for me this season was Assad Zaman as Armand. I wasn't sold on him at first, but then we get to see the 70s flashback episode with Armand \"mask off\", and I started to recognise all the little details/subtleties in his performance that showed the character's true self. Also Armand might be the funniest character in the show, like his fake crying in episode 6 was cracking me up. Excited to see more of the petty drama between these evil divas in season 3. It's giving Hannibal vibes. This will become a hit in years to come.",
        "I struggle to think who gave my favorite individual performance in the scene this season - they are all so crazy good, with so many outstanding scenes to choose from. Assad Zaman as the evil gremlin in the 70! Sam Reid during the trial talking about the sky drop! Delainey Hayles chewing Louis over his idiotic love choices! Ben Daniels imitating Louis in the restaurant! Eric Bogosian delight at exposing Armand! So so good. I think however that Jacob Anderson still had the best overall performance - showy heights, subtle lows, everything perfectly balanced. If only one person from the cast can be awarded, it should be him.",
        "I used to never watch remakes of shows/movies that were done right the first time\u2014that would\u2019ve been a big mistake in this case. This reimagined and re told tale was superbly written and acted with well considered nods to the original.",
        "Just to explain to all the people that are missing out on the best show on TV - that was a little funny moment in the middle of the most gutwrenchingly sad and beautiful scene from S2 finale of Interview with the Vampire. This and Louis meowing at a dead cat mid-insane rambling were both hilarious moments in very serious, emotional scenes in the finale",

Well, I'm really surprised at how much I've been enjoying it. The writing on the page is quite good and while I can't say I care that much about the plot the performances in this show are absolutely mesmerizing. The show has so many strenghts (music, production lighting, editing, directing...) and it's a testament to it that no matter how good it is on all these fronts, it's the acting that is shining above it all.",

I keep reading about this divide between the series and the readers (which seems like is almost ALWAYS a divide of some kind between the two fan bases and just seen how heated it got in the Shogun subforum). Is House of Dragons a book? I didn't think it was. EDIT: Just Googled it.. and apparently it is a book. Fire and Blood. I did not know.",

I'm including this parallel show, The House that dragons built, which made me think that we've really grown accustomed to quite spectacular standards of quality on our tv diet.

        "My experience with the show has been a little uneven, but the latest episode was really good IMO. Aegon and Otto continue to be standouts, but Alicent and Rhaenyra got my attention with their scene together in a way they hadn't quite this season. While I'm having some trouble placing Christon as a character, I'm starting to see him as a \"true knight\" in a satirical way. Like, he's a violent reckless moron, but someone gave him some shiny armor, so he gets to act poised and bully people \"for the realm,\" kinda like the knights in Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. He's not my favorite character, but I'm wondering if they are positioning him a bit like Jaime in early GoT. It seems to me that the character of Christon would massively benefit from, say, getting his hand chopped off, but I'm not claiming to really know what they plan to do with him.",
        "One of the worst episodes I have ever seen. The sexist writers keep ruining Alicent and Rhaenyra. Book Rhaenyra was so interesting but the show made her bland as can be. That final idiotic scene of the episode stands amongst the writing in S8. The entire episode is of S7 or S8 quality. The biggest crime for these episodes though is that they are just plain boring.",
        "Really liked this in Season 1 but I've totally bounced of this in Season 2 and have stopped watching. Has that 'prequelitis' feel of all the mediocre Star Wars stuff we've seen in the last decade and, as Andy Greenwald of The Watch podcast said, it feels like an expanded footnote from Game of Thrones. Lots and lots of long scenes of people talking in rooms as well. There's no White Walkers, no Free Cities, no Tyrion, no Varris, none of the great characters, big set pieces, and existential threats that made Game of Thrones so good. Hopefully HBO decides to take on some new fantasy/SF IP soon and just doesn't just make prequel shows in this universe for the foreseeable future, and I say that as a Game of Thrones reader. This adaptation was the rare case where I hadn't read an adaptation of a famous sf/fantasy book beforehand, and I was looking forward to being surprised, but, oh well.",
        "I've just had to finally accept this show isn't going to reach the heights of early seasons GOTs and just accept it for what it's worth.",
        "I'm like the biggest GOT fan here and i absolutely love HOTD it's getting gradually much better than I expected, HOTD is definitely building up it's characters unlike the mess of GOT season 8",
        "That was pretty obvious from season 1 to me. So many dumb and illogical stuff happened that it was more like season 8 of GOT. I was surprised honestly by how well it was received. But apparently it seems like people have had enough of the nonsense for season 2, don't know what's changed",
        "It's a different type of show. Despite sharing the same universe, I don't feel it makes a lot of sense to compare them. GOT was a sprawling epic featuring dozens of characters separated by entire continents and many parallel storylines, with a lot of time spent on mystery. It was a panorama, where HotD is more like a portrait or two, focused in tightly on a single conflict and a smaller cast. This may be an odd comparison but the difference feels like The Wire v. The Sopranos to me, in terms of one being kind of a large-scale view of an entire society and the other being a character study. They're so different it's tough to compare them and you don't expect one to scratch the itch of the other.",
        "I think it's especially tough to compare them at this point, since season 1 of HotD was more like a long prologue. It feels like we're only really 3-5 episodes deep into the show proper right now. Because the first 7 or so were just the intro."

Which is a shame for a show like this. Combined with the plot feeling like it\u2019s spinning its wheels, it\u2019s been a disappointing season. I don't care about any of the side stories and they all feel like time wasters and bring the mood way down. Frenchies past, Starlights past, Hughys dad, Komicos stuff, I just don't give a shit at all about any of that and so none of it has any weight and feels like pointless filler.",
        "That episode with the flying sheep was one of the worst hours of television. The series feels ugly and mean-spirited with its gore, showing human suffering in excruciating detail. Some episodes are stupid and campy, while others are tonally inconsistent. The show often features people standing still in rooms talking to each other, making it feel aimless and lacking movement. Some viewers feel the show is spinning its wheels and should have ended already. The cynicism in the series, stemming from Garth Ennis's comics, may not be for everyone and can be too much at times.",

This season's big mystery was so easy to guess, it's the most predictable cliche plot ever. Whole season is just some degenerate weird kink stuff and gore... they have no real plot left except for the final fight which will probably be in the final season.",

There are criticisms about the handling of male sexual assault as a comedic bit and comparisons to CW level writing. Hughie breaks down crying at the end, surprising viewers by not brushing off the sexual assault he experiences. Starlight's reactions to sexual abuse and exploitation are also mentioned.",

The narrative includes references to \"pizzagate,\" \"space lasers,\" and a \"weird santorum shout-out.\" Hughie breaking down crying at the end is highlighted, contrasting how he reacted to getting his feet tickled.",

        "Just finished S3 - it was good, not as great as S1-S2 but it could just be a preference for fewer character-specific episodes. My biggest takeaway from the show remains that there is no one as arrogant about their profession as chefs. S03E10 was full of so much fart-sniffing from chefs preaching about \"why\" they cook luxury meals for rich people in ridiculously expensive restaurants. A lot of the final episode felt like it was right on the edge of satire.",
        "The Bear S3 has been disappointing for me. We're treading water. The real and raw way relationships and emotions have been handled so tastefully in the first two seasons feels like it has teetered completely into the overwrought and melodramatic, even a bit flanderized. Can't help but feel like the writing has taken a bit of a nosedive. A couple great eps and moments though, and I like the commitment to format-pushing, like episode 1. Loved the first 2 seasons, hoping 4 can bring it home.",

Not really sure how The Bear went from being one of the best paced shows on tv to literally the slowest. I still enjoyed season 3, but I think they have gone a bit up their own ass with a focus on style instead of substance.",

There should\u2019ve been a better balance between character development and cooking in the new restaurant. The hectic cooking scene is what drew me to the show. Also, too many flashbacks! Some episodes are like only 30 mins, and 10 mins of flashbacks is too much. John Cena really felt like stunt casting and he felt so out of place.",
        "Damn I just saw the first episode of the new The Bear season and they definitely took a risk with that lack of dialogue and the pacing. I think I loved it but it was a lot of visual stimulation and not a lot of plot",

No issues with the acting performances but the writing and directing has been insufferable. I genuinely hope the rest of the season improves and if not, that the final season is a worthy end to what is a great show when it doesn't get in its own way.",

        "In all 10 episodes of S3 for The Bear, you can probably extract about an episode and a half, maybe 2, worth of plot or character development. The amount of fluff is unbelievable. Honestly kind of surreal and bizarre in hindsight, with an annoying hint of begrudgingly poetic.. like I was both frustrated and enamored by the season. There's an old saying in writing about keeping your promises to the reader/viewer, and man they just took the 3 major plot points >!(the review, an apology to Claire, Sydney's decision to leave/stay)!< and refused to fulfill any of them this season. Also, can any of these people just go to therapy? Like I know life is hard and can be real shitty, but goddamn the amount of bottling up every single character does in this show could fill and fly a hot air balloon. With that said, ya i'll be back for season 4. I pretty much treated season 3 as mini-episodes for the big season 4. Great execution in front of and behind the camera but just nothing to sink my teeth into. And the episodes where all the Fak brother's are in are bad. One series can handle only a few overbearing, loud, arrogant people. Bringing in a whole family like that just diluted all the scenes. Agreed. Some backstory content is neat. This is just too self-indulgent. I cannot think of a single time *in the history of television* in which a season refused to resolve or advance even a *single* plot thread. It's baffling... it's truly baffling... They could have at least given us >!the review!< straight, right at the end, so we would have one thing to go on... but they refused to even do that! And nobody has any idea what the >!actual review!< even was!! There is so much good about this show, and it is still one of my recent favorites, but this season is truly baffling. I honestly think this whole season could have been 2 or 3 episodes.",

Overuse of cameos making the show feel like an open Hollywood orgy. Main characters Carmy and Sydney are the most annoying and difficult to connect with. Fans want more of Richie, Sugar, Neil Fak, Tina, and Claire Bear.",

The \u201cto be continued\u201d is promising but as the season stands today I\u2019d give it a 6.5/10. Some episodes were fantastic, especially the one that Ayo Edebiri directed (\u2018Napkins\u2019 \u2014 featuring Tina\u2019s backstory) but the finale was meh. Maybe even worse than meh. It felt forced and out of alignment with the caliber of the others in the season.",

I'm told to like it by everyone, it's a masterpiece.",

SHOCKER. we realize her actual knowledge of the issues is superficial! Aha they're both wrong!\" is the core of the show even in season 3, and it's exhausting to not have any development of it at this point. Very much devolved into a sitcom at this point, and there's nothing wrong with sitcoms but I thought Hacks was trying to do something different.

Season 3 continued that with some pretty solid arcs early on, and then the season kicked into high gear in the latter half of the season. I liked how this season really pushed Ahsoka's development as her own person, rather than Anakin's underling, through both the main story arcs and a few side-adventures. In that sense, I thought it made sense to cap it off with the \"Padawan Lost\"/\"Wookiee Hunt\" two-parter, despite being less connected to the main story. We also get some nice early signs of Anakin's turn towards the dark side, especially in the really interesting \"Overlords\"/\"Altar of Mortis\"/\"Ghosts of Mortis\" arc, and a little bit in the arc after that when he says the Jedi don't go far enough in the war. And this was also a great season for Asajj Ventress, who has a few good arcs. Especially the \"Nightsisters\"/\"Monsters\"/\"Witches of the Mist\" arc, which may be my favorite arc of the series so far because of how unique it was with its perspective, and the dynamics at play."

And this being the end of the first arc, it ended on a pretty satisfying note, while setting some things up for the rest of the season.

The \"Get one.\" scene in the final episode gave me goosebumps. Followed up with the scene of Shoresy coming off his high as he starts limping again and realizes he is past his peak? It was beautiful. If you watch or play hockey, you need to watch this show. It is written by and features actual hockey players for most characters. It feels so authentic. If you like sports movies, watch this show. Each season feels like a standalone movie. And I know this comparison gets thrown around a lot, but if you liked Ted Lasso, go watch this. It's definitely more 'adult' orientated, but has a similar theme of not giving up and rallying a team/organization/community behind your efforts. Shoresy\u2019s chemistry with the sports reporter Laura is just off the charts. They found a great way to make his relentless innuendo really charming and sweet in their scenes.

And it's annoying what the final reveal will be that they're clones and there's at least a 3rd one because the one that starts the fire doesn't have Osha's face tattoo. So the big surprise is mwhaha an evil third triplet instead of the evil twin trope."

They don't all end with a puzzle that can even out whatever happened before. And there are Aussies in it. Season 11 was 47 days, btw. I think some of the older seasons are like 50\u201355 days, so it really is grueling compared to US Survivor's 26-day format. ***Australian Survivor*** is on a massive hot-streak. Three of its last four seasons have been straight bangers, with season 11 being the best of the bunch. It just has a pace that US Survivor can't match (and I loved Survivor 46, so it's definitely on the upswing, too). It's just so epic, with a great cast of characters, and the editors really hone in on the best storylines. I *do* happen to have easy access to all the episodes, but I've only seen seasons 8, 10, and 11, so I really should go back and watch the others... Though I've heard that Australian Survivor is afflicted with the \"every other season curse,\" where the odd-numbered seasons are weaker (a trend which season 11 breaks)."

        "After season 1 completely won me over, becoming my personal favorite of the new shows, this became my most anticipated TV show overall. Even more so after the issues since its cancellation/removal from Paramount+, the details from interviews and social media post by the writers, and initial feedback from those who saw the French release or reviewers who got it early. This season is actually much more serialized that season 1, but not exclusively so. After a few episodes, you start to see one-off episode ideas, which are often a lot of fun. I'd say many of these are on par with the better ones from season 1 (and very solid by Star Trek standards in general). And meanwhile, the serialized story ended up having a very complex plot by *any* standards, not just for \"kids\"/family TV. Even as an adult, the concepts can get a bit dizzying, especially in the episodes that lean into them the most. Though I do feel like the action and adventures are fun enough to captivate the younger viewers. Same with the connections to the larger Star Trek franchise - goes very deep with it, in a way that can feel satisfying to long-time fans, but not alienating to newcomers. And the best thing is, none of it feels forced and out of place. It's all very natural with the threads from season 1 which they're following through from. None of it takes away from the story of the new crew. And there's not one returning character whose presence I question in the slightest, but rather adds to the greater picture. One caveat: In season 1, I've understood people's resistance to the character Dal in early episodes. I even felt it myself at times, especially in the episode \"Starstruck.\" But over the season, I felt like he had a great arc where he becomes a much more likable character (even if still sometimes flawed). However, annoying Dal does come back again this season. It's understandable given the change in his situation, and once again he gets better as the season goes along, having some pretty great moments in later episodes. But it doesn't change how annoying some of his actions are early on. Even so, I'd strongly recommend this show to long-time Star Trek fans, newcomers to the franchise, fans of good sci-fi in general, and animation. Each season is good good in its own way, with season 2 being on another level for me."

        "Loved the book and hyped by the great reviews of the show. 5 minutes in and I am getting so distracted and annoyed by the anamorphic lenses and all those effects. I went online and see that there has been a lot of discussion about this, and how it is completely overdone through the whole series.",
        "Yeah, it definitely grasped me, despite the dogshit cinematography (focus breathing and film grain are also completely abused). The story is great and I feel the book gives me solid groundwork to appreciate the series even more. Happy to binge it in the coming days."

        "Very Important People with Vic Michaelis. Its on the Dropout app, but you can find it streaming online for free. Brilliant improvised show where the guest is put into full make-up and costumes and is forced to come up with a character on the spot and give an interview as them. Features a ton of todays best improvisers, and Vic is a national treasure"

        "I know it's cancelled going in. It's not masterpiece television, but it's Yellowstone, but not corny, with a bit of Westworld mythos tossed in. Sorta Station Eleven. And a bit Rectified. It's a bit of a bummer knowing that it's going to end up on some sort of cliffhanger that doesn't finish."

        "I recently started watching and I think it's fantastic. It's not quite 22 episodes, but it's close, having 19 episodes in its first and only season. Claire Danes is great in it. I'll be bummed when I wrap up watching the last five episodes. Given the mature topics the show touches on, it's wild to think that this show was allowed to run on ABC in 1994."

        "8-part anime on Netflix that has a really interesting hook (samurai get sent to a strange seemingly pantheistic island full of dangerous creatures) that is faintly reminiscent of Kong: Skull Island or the Annihilation book/movie on the high end. Never quite lives up to that promise, unfortunately, with the usual endless boring boss fights that mark this sub-genre, but it's worth a quick watch if you just want to turn your brain off for a bit and like anime with a bit of a surreal twist. I really enjoyed the premise of Hell's Paradise but not where it ended. I hope more will get made and it goes somewhere. I think I once wished for Made In Abyss but with older characters and it is sort like that. It's just not game of thrones so expecting that is setting yourself up for failure. It's a good show in its own right."
