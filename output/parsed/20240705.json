But Louis's intoxicating new powers come with a violent price, and the introduction of Lestat's newest fledgling, the child vampire Claudia, soon sets them on a decades-long path of revenge and atonement.</p>",

            "Great sophomore season, continually impressed with the cast and acting. Faithful (mostly) to the source material as well.",
            "I watched season 1 as more of a background show. It seemed slow at times so didn\u2019t always grab my attention. After reading the good reviews here on season 2 I decided to give it a go and wow! Rarely do I feel shows get better with season 2 but this one definitely did. Two episodes in and I went back to give season 1 a re-watch and this time it had my full attention. Really loving this showing and it\u2019s fast becoming a favorite that I feel will be on rotation when there\u2019s nothing new to watch. The show has such a great rewatch value, they really are utilizing little details sprinkled around the episodes to pay it off by the time the finale rolls around. Plus a lot of plot clues are hidden or hinted at in the dialogue, so it really rewards you paying attention.",
            "Finally got around to starting this. I thought season one was pretty good, but S2 is *miles* above imo. I've been seeing the weekly comments praising it and I can cofirm they are legit.",
            "Sometimes the tonal balancing act doesn't work but my god am I entertained, and these actors are so so good. A stand out for me this season was Assad Zaman as Armand. I wasn't sold on him at first, but then we get to see the 70s flashback episode with Armand \"mask off\", and I started to recognise all the little details/subtleties in his performance that showed the character's true self. Also Armand might be the funniest character in the show, like his fake crying in episode 6 was cracking me up. Excited to see more of the petty drama between these evil divas in season 3. It's giving Hannibal vibes. This will become a hit in years to come.",
            "I struggle to think who gave my favorite individual performance in the scene this season - they are all so crazy good, with so many outstanding scenes to choose from. Assad Zaman as the evil gremlin in the 70! Sam Reid during the trial talking about the sky drop! Delainey Hayles chewing Louis over his idiotic love choices! Ben Daniels imitating Louis in the restaurant! Eric Bogosian delight at exposing Armand! So so good. I think however that Jacob Anderson still had the best overall performance - showy heights, subtle lows, everything perfectly balanced. If only one person from the cast can be awarded, it should be him.",
            "I used to never watch remakes of shows/movies that were done right the first time\u2014that would\u2019ve been a big mistake in this case. This reimagined and re told tale was superbly written and acted with well considered nods to the original.",
            "Just to explain to all the people that are missing out on the best show on TV - that was a little funny moment in the middle of the most gutwrenchingly sad and beautiful scene from S2 finale of Interview with the Vampire. This and Louis meowing at a dead cat mid-insane rambling were both hilarious moments in very serious, emotional scenes in the finale",
            "Give Sam Reid all the awards. The acting of the entire cast is incredible.",
            "-Interview with the Vampire season 2",
            "I really thought I would dislike it because emo vampire series are not my cup of tea usually but I heard good things about it so I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, I'm really surprised at how much I've been enjoying it. The writing on the page is quite good and while I can't say I care that much about the plot the performances in this show are absolutely mesmerizing. The show has so many strenghts (music, production lighting, editing, directing...) and it's a testament to it that no matter how good it is on all these fronts, it's the acting that is shining above it all.",
            "One of the best shows airing right now imho.",
            "was amazing. I highly recommend it.",
            "I'm catching up on now and really enjoying it, except the new Claudia actress's attempt at the New Orleans accent is horrific - it's not good that I could immediately tell she was British, her British accent slips through in almost every line.",
            "Some episodes are among the best in recent years. Louis lead is very good. Lestat and Molloy the journalist are brilliant. Highly recommended.",
            "Dark, brutal, depressing and beautifully heartfelt. The show of the highest quality.",
            "Also watching and enjoying Interview with the Vampire."

Frenchies past, Starlights past, Hughys dad, Komicos stuff, I just don't give a shit at all about any of that and so none of it has any weight and feels like pointless filler.",
            "That episode with the flying sheep was one of the worst hours of television. The series feels ugly and mean-spirited with its gore, showing human suffering in excruciating detail. Some episodes are stupid and campy, while others are tonally inconsistent. The show often features people standing still in rooms talking to each other, making it feel aimless and lacking movement. Some viewers feel the show is spinning its wheels and should have ended already. The cynicism in the series, stemming from Garth Ennis's comics, may not be for everyone and can be too much at times.",
            "kinda depressing with all the right wing conspiracy stuff happening and I hope the subplots with hughie and frenchie build up to something.",
            "It's just bad... it almost feels episodic now. No real progress just random side missions and reset everything at the end. This season's big mystery was so easy to guess, it's the most predictable cliche plot ever. Whole season is just some degenerate weird kink stuff and gore... they have no real plot left except for the final fight which will probably be in the final season.",
            "The show is getting worse with too many filler episodes and the gore is becoming boring after 4 seasons. The writers seem to have run out of creativity, but the first 2 seasons were good.",
            "S4 is really not on the same level of quality as previous seasons but I really enjoyed episode 5. Definitely the best episode of the season so far. Hopefully they will nail the final episodes of the season.",
            "Waiting on episodes",
            "I've given up on... I found myself horrified (as usual) but then I thought that it was not worth it. Like when you are quitting smoking or something... I guess some people must find this cocktail of ultraviolence paired with cynicism appealing enough, but I just had enough.",
            "The show has turned into a parody of itself, with some finding the writing to be bad and the satire on \"stupid republicans and rich white men\" to be less clever. There are criticisms about the handling of male sexual assault as a comedic bit and comparisons to CW level writing. Hughie breaks down crying at the end, surprising viewers by not brushing off the sexual assault he experiences. Starlight's reactions to sexual abuse and exploitation are also mentioned.",
            "Some viewers feel the showrunners are not clever enough in their criticism and resort to using well-known shorthands to make their points. The narrative includes references to \"pizzagate,\" \"space lasers,\" and a \"weird santorum shout-out.\" Hughie breaking down crying at the end is highlighted, contrasting how he reacted to getting his feet tickled.",
            "this wacky ass show has me losing brain cells faster than my wallet goes empty.",
            "Watching The Boys just makes you remember how much better Watchmen is(all of it)",
            "working my way through the episodes released from season 4 so far, and unfortunately, i cant recommend this season. Ive never found myself so bored by the show before. Feels like they are just spinning the wheels and not going anywhere, very slowly.",
            "A complete and utter ass of an episode. What a waste of time. The writers don't respect their own writing nor the viewer, thinking they need shock value every 10mins to keep us engaged. We are 6 episode in and there had been no real progress in the story outside the virus. Which seems to be something that got more development in Gen V than it did in The Boys.",
            "This season is the best one yet."

Joel Edgerton who plays some of the main characters managed to create a clear different feel for each of them without using excessive showmanship/accessories to highlight the differences. It's a must try for fans of quality sci-fi. Also highly character driven and goes much further with the concept than I expected them to in a single season. Really good stuff.",

            "Watching Dark Matter and people might say the beginning is slow, but what they are really doing is setting up the characters and the situation so that you have a good feel for the relationships, some of how he feels about how his career and life has turned out and the opportunities he may have missed, and how he loves his family. It's this kind of effective setup work that really gives the audience context and investment for what he must be feeling later on as things go topsy-turvy. They also do a good job of building up the mystery and suspense before doing a reveal at the end that leaves the viewer really wanting to see more.",

All of his recent milestones have been undone, including his success at work and his marriage to the love of his life Sarah. Worst of all, he seems to be the only one who has noticed what's happened.\u00a0That is, until he meets Archie, who recruits George for the Lazarus Project - a secret organisation that has harnessed the ability to turn back time every time the world is at threat of extinction. Like George, those who work at Lazarus are the few people on earth with the ability to remember the events that are undone when time goes back. Alongside colleagues Archie, standoffish Shiv, and their steely leader Wes, George works to prevent global catastrophe \u2013 including trying to track down the formidable Rebrov, a wanted criminal intent on detonating a nuclear warhead and destroying the world.\u00a0Then a freak accident harms someone close to George. Lazarus won't let him turn back time to undo it \u2013 unless there is the threat of global extinction. Now George must choose to stay loyal or go rogue, as he is faced with the question: if you had the power to rewrite your past, what would you sacrifice to do it\u2026?</p>",

I keep reading about this divide between the series and the readers (which seems like is almost ALWAYS a divide of some kind between the two fan bases and just seen how heated it got in the Shogun subforum). Is House of Dragons a book? I didn't think it was. EDIT: Just Googled it.. and apparently it is a book. Fire and Blood. I did not know.",

            "People are complaining it's bad, but it's so much better than anything on TV right now.",

            "I love this show so much. The drama, the acting and the score are excellent. The weakest part of it is the dragons lol which is kind of ironic.",
            "Also watching which is the best thing on television right now. Can't believe how good this show is, from cinematography to writing to incredible acting. Wow! This is just brilliant.",
            "I'm also rewatching... which is of course pretty good... I'm including this parallel show, The House that dragons built, which made me think that we've really grown accustomed to quite spectacular standards of quality on our tv diet. It's bananas what this people manage to accomplish, the amount of geniuses working hand in hand in there. And Paddy Considine is extraordinary as Viserys. Talk about an Emmy snub.",
            "I use the 3rd one, has the most comments per ep",
            "Also watching and enjoying HOTD.",
            "My experience with the show has been a little uneven, but the latest episode was really good IMO. Aegon and Otto continue to be standouts, but Alicent and Rhaenyra got my attention with their scene together in a way they hadn't quite this season. While I'm having some trouble placing Christon as a character, I'm starting to see him as a \"true knight\" in a satirical way. Like, he's a violent reckless moron, but someone gave him some shiny armor, so he gets to act poised and bully people \"for the realm,\" kinda like the knights in Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. He's not my favorite character, but I'm wondering if they are positioning him a bit like Jaime in early GoT. It seems to me that the character of Christon would massively benefit from, say, getting his hand chopped off, but I'm not claiming to really know what they plan to do with him.",
            "One of the worst episodes I have ever seen. The sexist writers keep ruining Alicent and Rhaenyra. Book Rhaenyra was so interesting but the show made her bland as can be. That final idiotic scene of the episode stands amongst the writing in S8. The entire episode is of S7 or S8 quality. The biggest crime for these episodes though is that they are just plain boring.",
            "Really liked this in Season 1 but I've totally bounced of this in Season 2 and have stopped watching. Has that 'prequelitis' feel of all the mediocre Star Wars stuff we've seen in the last decade and, as Andy Greenwald of The Watch podcast said, it feels like an expanded footnote from Game of Thrones. Lots and lots of long scenes of people talking in rooms as well. There's no White Walkers, no Free Cities, no Tyrion, no Varris, none of the great characters, big set pieces, and existential threats that made Game of Thrones so good. Hopefully HBO decides to take on some new fantasy/SF IP soon and just doesn't just make prequel shows in this universe for the foreseeable future, and I say that as a Game of Thrones reader. This adaptation was the rare case where I hadn't read an adaptation of a famous sf/fantasy book beforehand, and I was looking forward to being surprised, but, oh well.",
            "I've just had to finally accept this show isn't going to reach the heights of early seasons GOTs and just accept it for what it's worth.",
            "I'm like the biggest GOT fan here and i absolutely love HOTD it's getting gradually much better than I expected, HOTD is definitely building up it's characters unlike the mess of GOT season 8",
            "That was pretty obvious from season 1 to me. So many dumb and illogical stuff happened that it was more like season 8 of GOT. I was surprised honestly by how well it was received. But apparently it seems like people have had enough of the nonsense for season 2, don't know what's changed",
            "It's a different type of show. Despite sharing the same universe, I don't feel it makes a lot of sense to compare them. GOT was a sprawling epic featuring dozens of characters separated by entire continents and many parallel storylines, with a lot of time spent on mystery. It was a panorama, where HotD is more like a portrait or two, focused in tightly on a single conflict and a smaller cast. This may be an odd comparison but the difference feels like The Wire v. The Sopranos to me, in terms of one being kind of a large-scale view of an entire society and the other being a character study. They're so different it's tough to compare them and you don't expect one to scratch the itch of the other.",
            "I think it's especially tough to compare them at this point, since season 1 of HotD was more like a long prologue. It feels like we're only really 3-5 episodes deep into the show proper right now. Because the first 7 or so were just the intro."

Very much devolved into a sitcom at this point, and there's nothing wrong with sitcoms but I thought Hacks was trying to do something different. The worst of it is how we repeatedly get these unfathomably cringe bits that are blatantly trying to make a metacommentary on the industry and zeitgeist but just. Reiterates the zeitgeist? instead of adding anything new at all."

I\u2019m glad I took a chance on this one as it was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the better ITV offerings I\u2019ve seen in years. The show nailed the balance between comedy and drama and was very satisfying despite hinting at some dark subject matter. The main cast was very good particularly the two leads Karen Gillan and Hugh Bonneville. I also liked the pacing of the show and how the plot developed in an unexpected but enthralling way. It was only 4 episodes long but that seemed the perfect amount of time needed to tell this story.",
            "Nearly miss Douglas is cancelled. Looks interesting.",
            "Karen Gillan gives an amazing performance, but the show is a bit stuffed with messages and muddled tones. Plus, the rapid dialogue does the opening acts few favors. It becomes more interesting in the last half once the quips settle down and the mood darkens. I\u2019m glad I watched it and thought it was worth the time, but wish it had shown more restraint."

It was a fascinating story that I was completely unaware of being neither American or a basketball fan. The show mixed drama and comedy well and had fantastic performances from most of the cast. Crazy story but a real fun TV show!",
            "Just finished the finale of **Clipped** and I still can't tell if Donald Sterling was really that off kilter or if the show just hams him up a bit. I might need to listen to the podcast the show is adapted from. That said, six episodes was the perfect length for this. FX tends to do well with miniseries."

Now they are exploring how the kids feel and the princess wanting to find her real mom. I doubt any series will actually do that."

            "Netflix just dropped season two and its even better than season one. The first handful of episodes from S1 feel like Star Wars, which was absolutely intentional to hook young viewers. After that it got better and better and more Trek in all the best ways. Season two has a different feel in that there are far less standalone episodes but it is just as good if not better than season one. Its marketed to kids but its for everyone. Yes, there are things that are obviously targeted at children but if you're a fan of Trek, even if you're a scifi fan who has never watched Trek, you will enjoy this show. Long time Trek viewers will be rewarded with tie-ins to Next Generation, Voyager, Picard, Trek Shorts, and there's even a funny mention of the Cerritos. I don't think any of that is a spoiler, its an incentive. I liked the show from the start, but can see how it may take some time for it to click with others. But it's gotten progressively better as it's gone on. This season was on another level for me. I really hope it does well enough to get a season 3 because it deserves it. Plus the set-up for a potential new story is very interesting. But even if it doesn't, it's a hell of a journey with a very satisfying ending in its own way.",
            "After season 1 completely won me over, becoming my personal favorite of the new shows, this became my most anticipated TV show overall. Even more so after the issues since its cancellation/removal from Paramount+, the details from interviews and social media post by the writers, and initial feedback from those who saw the French release or reviewers who got it early. This season is actually much more serialized that season 1, but not exclusively so. After a few episodes, you start to see one-off episode ideas, which are often a lot of fun. I'd say many of these are on par with the better ones from season 1 (and very solid by Star Trek standards in general). And meanwhile, the serialized story ended up having a very complex plot by *any* standards, not just for \"kids\"/family TV. Even as an adult, the concepts can get a bit dizzying, especially in the episodes that lean into them the most. Though I do feel like the action and adventures are fun enough to captivate the younger viewers. Same with the connections to the larger Star Trek franchise - goes very deep with it, in a way that can feel satisfying to long-time fans, but not alienating to newcomers. And the best thing is, none of it feels forced and out of place. It's all very natural with the threads from season 1 which they're following through from. None of it takes away from the story of the new crew. And there's not one returning character whose presence I question in the slightest, but rather adds to the greater picture. One caveat: In season 1, I've understood people's resistance to the character Dal in early episodes. I even felt it myself at times, especially in the episode \"Starstruck.\" But over the season, I felt like he had a great arc where he becomes a much more likable character (even if still sometimes flawed). However, annoying Dal does come back again this season. It's understandable given the change in his situation, and once again he gets better as the season goes along, having some pretty great moments in later episodes. But it doesn't change how annoying some of his actions are early on. Even so, I'd strongly recommend this show to long-time Star Trek fans, newcomers to the franchise, fans of good sci-fi in general, and animation. Each season is good good in its own way, with season 2 being on another level for me."

But for all its familiar, small-town trappings, things in this secret hamlet are anything but ordinary. The stereotype of the absent-minded professor exists for a reason, and most of the quantum leaps in science and technology during the past 50 years were produced by Eureka's elite researchers. Unfortunately, scientific exploration is rarely what one expects, and years of experiments gone awry have yielded some peculiar by-products.</p><p>With the population's unique talents, troubled psyches and limitless resources, these small-town concerns have a way of becoming big-time problems.

            "Logical inconsistencies everywhere, poor set and costume design, terrible acting, atrocious writing and dialogue, garbage cinematography and an extremely poor usage of The Volume.",

Episode 5 had some bad cuts and some of the writing still struggled but it had some awesome sequences and Jacinto is a great Starwars addition in general. I really liked this latest episode. There wasn't a lot of action but the writing and directing was a huge improvement.",
            "The actor after the reveal turned it up to a 10. Their acting is in another tier compared to everyone else.",
            "Acolyte is doing the identical twin tropes wrong. Like at the start of the first episode they were trying to set up a possible dual identity where she is a mechanic and then on her days off she's an assassin. Should have stretched that plot point out a little further, like maybe it is a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. But now they've gone full blown Alien Covenant screenwriting. Which while that was bad, at least David wasn't dealing with Space wizards and also sporting a prominent face tattoo. Like they showed Maes has a small tattoo on her arm, great chekov's gun for when the Master sees OSHA doesn't have it and has switched places with her. Only problem being HER GODDAMN FACE TATTOO. I don't think any hair cut is gonna matter with this giant forehead mark. And it's annoying what the final reveal will be that they're clones and there's at least a 3rd one because the one that starts the fire doesn't have Osha's face tattoo. So the big surprise is mwhaha an evil third triplet instead of the evil twin trope."

            "Season 3 was okay, definitely wasn't as good as the first 2 seasons. It was just a building up season.",
            "Kinda curious for people who are fully caught up on The Bear. Do you feel S4 will be the last season? Honestly I almost feel like the show was initially supposed to be 3 seasons and it got stretched with this filler season. I feel like season 3 is a clear rampup to season 4 and therefore doesn't work as well as a standalone. I think they won't overstay their welcome, so 4 may well be the final season. Especially with Ayo and Jeremy's stars blowing up. I think they will for sure push for a 4th. If for nothing else just to prove that the show still has some integrity. I couldn't even get through this season and I was a die hard fan of the first two.",
            "This show about a young chef running a family restaurant is getting rave reviews for its storytelling and performances.",
            "Just finished S3 - it was good, not as great as S1-S2 but it could just be a preference for fewer character-specific episodes. My biggest takeaway from the show remains that there is no one as arrogant about their profession as chefs. S03E10 was full of so much fart-sniffing from chefs preaching about \"why\" they cook luxury meals for rich people in ridiculously expensive restaurants. A lot of the final episode felt like it was right on the edge of satire.",
            "The Bear S3 has been disappointing for me. We're treading water. The real and raw way relationships and emotions have been handled so tastefully in the first two seasons feels like it has teetered completely into the overwrought and melodramatic, even a bit flanderized. Can't help but feel like the writing has taken a bit of a nosedive. A couple great eps and moments though, and I like the commitment to format-pushing, like episode 1. Loved the first 2 seasons, hoping 4 can bring it home.",
            "I fast forwarded through a lot of the episodes just to get through the season.",
            "Been watching the new season of the Bear. I'm 4 episodes in and the only thing that's happened is Syd leased an apartment. Agreed. Not really sure how The Bear went from being one of the best paced shows on tv to literally the slowest. I still enjoyed season 3, but I think they have gone a bit up their own ass with a focus on style instead of substance.",
            "Need to start the new season but slowly becoming less excited for it as I hear the reviews others are giving it.",
            "The Bear season 3 was about four episodes stretched to ten. Other than the Fak stuff nothing was outright terrible but it wasn\u2019t very compelling either.",
            "It's never been a plot driven show, I know that, but it felt especially slow this season. Plus I just feel that we didn't get enough Richie, Carm and Syd and too much of the Faks. There should\u2019ve been a better balance between character development and cooking in the new restaurant. The hectic cooking scene is what drew me to the show. Also, too many flashbacks! Some episodes are like only 30 mins, and 10 mins of flashbacks is too much. John Cena really felt like stunt casting and he felt so out of place.",
            "Damn I just saw the first episode of the new The Bear season and they definitely took a risk with that lack of dialogue and the pacing. I think I loved it but it was a lot of visual stimulation and not a lot of plot",
            "I am such a fan of this show, but this first episode of season 3 was confusing to watch. I wasn't too sure of the timeline. Loved the visuals, but didn't get a lot of setup for the season from it.",
            "The first episode of season 3 is like a 40 minute Trent Reznor music video. And yknow what? I'm into it.",
            "But also a little of that can go a long way.",
            "Brilliant.",
            "I've only watched the first four episodes of season 3 of The Bear but...woof. I don't need things to move fast for the sake of moving fast but I agree with the reviews calling this season \"aimless\" so far. I feel like I'm watching a SNL skit parodying the show. No issues with the acting performances but the writing and directing has been insufferable. I genuinely hope the rest of the season improves and if not, that the final season is a worthy end to what is a great show when it doesn't get in its own way.",
            "Finished The Bear s3 and it was pretty disappointing. All style no substance",
            "A lot of it is still good, but it feels a little like all the endless praise got to them. Quite a few \"look at us making \u2728art\u2728\" type episodes.",
            "-The Bear season 3",
            "In all 10 episodes of S3 for The Bear, you can probably extract about an episode and a half, maybe 2, worth of plot or character development. The amount of fluff is unbelievable. Honestly kind of surreal and bizarre in hindsight, with an annoying hint of begrudgingly poetic.. like I was both frustrated and enamored by the season. There's an old saying in writing about keeping your promises to the reader/viewer, and man they just took the 3 major plot points >!(the review, an apology to Claire, Sydney's decision to leave/stay)!< and refused to fulfill any of them this season. Also, can any of these people just go to therapy? Like I know life is hard and can be real shitty, but goddamn the amount of bottling up every single character does in this show could fill and fly a hot air balloon. With that said, ya i'll be back for season 4. I pretty much treated season 3 as mini-episodes for the big season 4. Great execution in front of and behind the camera but just nothing to sink my teeth into. And the episodes where all the Fak brother's are in are bad. One series can handle only a few overbearing, loud, arrogant people. Bringing in a whole family like that just diluted all the scenes. Agreed. Some backstory content is neat. This is just too self-indulgent. I cannot think of a single time *in the history of television* in which a season refused to resolve or advance even a *single* plot thread. It's baffling... it's truly baffling... They could have at least given us >!the review!< straight, right at the end, so we would have one thing to go on... but they refused to even do that! And nobody has any idea what the >!actual review!< even was!! There is so much good about this show, and it is still one of my recent favorites, but this season is truly baffling. I honestly think this whole season could have been 2 or 3 episodes.",
            "I enjoyed the reflections on previous employment, the discussion of restaurants meanings, and what it's like to serve people.",
            "Finishing up the season 2",
            "I started watching the first couple of episodes of The Bear in the 1st season which were insanely good and better than I even expected. I heard people say the 3rd season was the weakest, but I still plan on bingeing the rest of 1st season and 2nd season.",
            "Just finished season 3 of The Bear a few hours ago. Dude, that show is so good.",
            "Season 3 through 7 episodes. Episode 1-5 involves kitchen stuff and yelling. Episode 6 is the best so far, no kitchen stuff, tells a story, a human story. Excellent.",
            "Episode 6 is the worst so far for me",
            "Watching s03. It's so dramatic.",
            "Just finished the Napkins episode of the bear and need Jon Bernthal to stop playing and adopted me as his long lost son already.",
            "Watched all of season 3 and I was disappointed in the finale, it was a good episode but felt like it needed one more episode so hopefully season 4 will wrap things up a bit",
            "A big downgrade from the first two seasons, focused more on making \"prestige television\" and less on actual story. Too much music, hard to differentiate flashback scenes from present. Overuse of cameos making the show feel like an open Hollywood orgy. Main characters Carmy and Sydney are the most annoying and difficult to connect with. Fans want more of Richie, Sugar, Neil Fak, Tina, and Claire Bear.",
            "This season was beautiful, artistic, and carries through a cacophonous tone throughout the season\u2019s spans. However, there was almost zero plot development. The \u201cto be continued\u201d is promising but as the season stands today I\u2019d give it a 6.5/10. Some episodes were fantastic, especially the one that Ayo Edebiri directed (\u2018Napkins\u2019 \u2014 featuring Tina\u2019s backstory) but the finale was meh. Maybe even worse than meh. It felt forced and out of alignment with the caliber of the others in the season.",
            "The pacing, the music, the tension and grief. Diehard Trent/Atticus fan. Hypnotic and beautiful. Sound mixing in the episode was superb. Great programme. Reminds me of Atlanta in a lot of ways with its creativity and almost stand alone episodes.",
            "I'm 5 episodes into the season, it's good so far. I did think the 1st episode was kind of redundant as most of what was shown was already known to the audience.",
            "It doesn't feel like a complete season, it kind of feels like a setup for whatever is going to happen season 4. Still a lot of great stuff in it though, I enjoyed it. Is it a sad show? Will it make you cry?",
            "not good.",
            "Season 3 is highly anticipated!",
            "Just don\u2019t get The Bear",
            "The series as a whole is pretty good and I enjoy it as a peak into a culture I know nothing about, but the last season is much weaker and it felt like there was a fractured filming schedule with the cast or something.",
            "I've read that S3 and S4 were filmed concurrently so I think S3 is just a bridge season to build for S4 which is apparently going to be coming out later this year.",
            "Caught up on S2 just in time to start S3. My girlfriend and I watched E1 and she didn't enjoy it but I LOVED it. What a fascinating way to show the whole backstory that we've seen alluded to.",
            "binged 10eps. still great but IMO not as good as s2 and ends in a brutal cliffhanger. still great for acting/music/editing/stress/wholesome scenes",
            "I have only watched 3 episodes. It is over rated by the fans and under rated by some haters. Ep1 was not really for me but I appreciate they are trying. E2 and 3 brought me right back cause I like the kitchen actions! It is definitely the water cooler show on the internet. The Bear is the Oppenheimer of TV shows. I'm told to like it by everyone, it's a masterpiece.",
            "Watched the premiere of **The Bear** and I get why people are saying the season is as pretentious as it is anemic. However I liked the minimal use of dialogue and the introspective angle given the events of the season 2 finale. While I have yet to catch the rest of the season, I refuse to believe it's the most unfocused mess of a season when The Morning Show's second season exists.",
            "Peak television in terms of the filmmaking, the editing and the acting. Taking it slow by watching an episode randomly cause I don\u2019t want it to get over soon.",
            "Yeah, it had its problems. But overall I still found it to be an extremely watchable and compelling show. I thought it finished on a really high note and the music was consistently good throughout the show. I also thought Ayo Edibiri really toned down the affectations on the Chef Syd character which made her performance all the more enjoyable. I'll definitely be watching Season 4.",
            "Christ, The Bear S3E8. It is Sopranos level. I'm also watching the Bear... I still am baffled as to why this show keeps getting nominated in the Comedy category. Put it in Drama where it belongs.",
            "Constant gay sex, drama with comedic elements, serious tone, revolves around a dysfunctional family and the one they create at the restaurant, won a prime time Emmy for Outstanding Comedy.",
            "Season 3 is finally coming!",
            "I have a love-hate relationship with this show. I fell in love with season 1 and then disliked season 2. This season has had a few misses but this ep was one of their best ever and just insanely good television.",
            "Just curious, what didn't you like about season 2? I thought it was great, offered a lot of insight into the \"family\" dynamics and history, lots of character development and so on. If you didn't like season 2 and prefer season 3, I am definitely looking forward to it!",
            "Season 3 has been confirmed!",
            "The bear S3 was such a perfect love (and hate) letter to the industry. Eps 6 and 8 were phenomenal. 10 made me cry. I loved just hearing the chefs talk. So beautiful. I fricking love the Faks. Matty was so good this season. Absolutely shocked if JLC doesn\u2019t win the Emmy this year. This was a step down from last year\u2019s absolutely perfect season but still so much to love. For me, the one change I would make is minimise the needle drops. Just too many. Weezer rule though."

I was also slightly annoyed by it, since you are mostly waiting for the characters to catch up to the viewer. Or they do things like try a single thing to solve something unknown, it doesn't work, and then they never bother with it again. Considering it's based on a finished book series I will stick with it, no danger of it going off the rails, and I like the setting."

I actually have Deep ThoughtsTM about the reaction online to the older women who are running the show: the two coaches and managers and Charlotte Jones. I recently saw a TT where someone was excoriating them as horrible, awful, mean, terrible, but the only concrete example was the insistence that they be called \"ma'am.\" I dunno, I think this is sexism and internalized misogyny with a sprinkle of ageism, frankly. I didn't see these older women cursing, insulting, or otherwise treating these younger women with anything but stern respect and having very high standards. I strongly (strongly) suspect if these were men, we would have nothing to say except that they were \"geniuses\" like Steve Jobs types. They are exacting and focused Type A people, so what. One of them (Kelly I believe) is directly responsible for growing the DCC into a multi million dollar org. I don't want to hear what a \"bitch\" she is. She's a hard nosed business-person, sure. But this take really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure it's up to Charlotte Jones per se to decide on the DCC salaries (the other area the TT-er was going on about) and it is a part time entertaiment job that 1000s of women want. I can imagine it's very difficult to peg that market rate for that job."

            "summary": "<p>Out of the blackness, the first thing Jack senses is pain. Then burning sun. A Bamboo forest. Smoke. Screams. With a rush comes the horrible awareness that the plane he was on tore apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his help.</p><p>Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. Some panic. Some pin their hopes on rescue. A few find inner strength they never knew they had -- like Kate, who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's wounds. Hurley - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to survive. Charlie is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid is a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin and Sun are a Korean couple whose traditions, values and language are foreign, and thus causes much to get lost in the translation. Sawyer has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt, after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others. Self-centered Shannon - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone , constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. And young Claire is eight months pregnant and ill-prepared for the hardships of motherhood - especially on a deserted island.</p>",

            "I was boycotting it for some reason during its original run, but now I decided that it's time to check it out. I like the mystery and the unknowns. The characters however are very annoying - they talk and act like 9-graders. Maybe there's a reason for this - we'll see. The main villain they introduced in S3 is really cool though. The actor is great and for now it seems that he's well written. Overall, I'm liking it - it keeps me hooked, but sometimes I just wonder if the writers have smoked some weird shit. There\u2019s no reason for them talking like that. That\u2019s just mid-late 2000s tv for ya."

Highly, highly recommend the show. Its probably my favorite private detective series of all time. Just hits all my private-detective buttons in a good way. CB Strike show is usually one book behind, so if you're hungry for more, grab the book. You can also read the series and get more that way as the show does a very good job for the most part following the book."

            "The Clone Wars: I've been enjoying this show so far, even back in season 1, with it gradually and steadily getting stronger as it went on. Season 3 continued that with some pretty solid arcs early on, and then the season kicked into high gear in the latter half of the season. I liked how this season really pushed Ahsoka's development as her own person, rather than Anakin's underling, through both the main story arcs and a few side-adventures. In that sense, I thought it made sense to cap it off with the \"Padawan Lost\"/\"Wookiee Hunt\" two-parter, despite being less connected to the main story. We also get some nice early signs of Anakin's turn towards the dark side, especially in the really interesting \"Overlords\"/\"Altar of Mortis\"/\"Ghosts of Mortis\" arc, and a little bit in the arc after that when he says the Jedi don't go far enough in the war. And this was also a great season for Asajj Ventress, who has a few good arcs. Especially the \"Nightsisters\"/\"Monsters\"/\"Witches of the Mist\" arc, which may be my favorite arc of the series so far because of how unique it was with its perspective, and the dynamics at play."

Ezran had some interesting growth, as He went back to become king, even if only temporarily. I also liked both Callum and Rayla's character development this season as well. And this being the end of the first arc, it ended on a pretty satisfying note, while setting some things up for the rest of the season. I like how Claudia and Soren are on different sides now, with Soren in particular having some nice growth here. And the last episode was a strong, exciting way to tie some of the threads up for now."

            "Absolutely the best season so far. I'm constantly in awe of how this show took a side-show 'gross out' gag from Letterkenny and made him a fully-fleshed out human character. The \"Get one.\" scene in the final episode gave me goosebumps. Followed up with the scene of Shoresy coming off his high as he starts limping again and realizes he is past his peak? It was beautiful. If you watch or play hockey, you need to watch this show. It is written by and features actual hockey players for most characters. It feels so authentic. If you like sports movies, watch this show. Each season feels like a standalone movie. And I know this comparison gets thrown around a lot, but if you liked Ted Lasso, go watch this. It's definitely more 'adult' orientated, but has a similar theme of not giving up and rallying a team/organization/community behind your efforts. Shoresy\u2019s chemistry with the sports reporter Laura is just off the charts. They found a great way to make his relentless innuendo really charming and sweet in their scenes. The romantic elements of Shoresy and Letterkenny are underrated.",
            "Some complaints about too much montage and not enough storytelling through dialogue. Disagreement on the purpose of the season as a character study with full character development and motivations on display. John Cena's cameo and the expansion of the Fak family were welcomed. Continuous anxiety build-up for Carmine and a potential cathartic release in his confrontation with Chef David from the past. Food montages seen as self-indulgent but display a passion for the industry.",

            "Finished The Sympathizer. All in all a good show that I'm surprised wasn't discussed more here. Struggled at the beginning with the over the top style and some questionable creatives choices but it was worth pushing through as the story and characters were really interesting. I also think that the show struggled with what it's tone choices but the juggling between emotional and dark comedy was still interesting. I really dug it until the final episode, still worth watching. I had to drop it by like ep 5. It's nothing like what I expected. I'm sure some people are gonna love it but it just felt like such a slog of personal drama. I thought it was gonna be about big politics and the Vietnam war and spy stuff. Amazing. Dug it but didn\u2019t finish, too hard for my stoner brain to keep up"

Attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy in his strained community, police chief Kevin Garvey faces additional challenges at home with his daughter, Jill, who's lost in a cloud of apathy with her friend Aimee, and son, Tom, who has gravitated to a cult led by the charismatic Holy Wayne.

With his perpetual \"yes, me worry\" expression, Frankie Muniz instantly earns audience empathy as Malcolm, whose chances for a normal life are thwarted not only by his genius IQ, but also by his outrageously dysfunctional family: Lois, his obsessive, control-freak mother; Hal, his loving but ineffectual father; Francis, his eldest brother waging his own private war at military school; middle brother Reese, a delinquent savant; and Dewey, the put-upon youngest. As Malcolm observes at one point, \"This family may be rude, loud and gross, and have no shame whatsoever, but with them you know where you stand.\"</p>",

            "People said this show was better than the US version, but I had no idea how much better. They're there for a longer time. 40 days I think. 24 episodes. Challenges are harder. They don't all end with a puzzle that can even out whatever happened before. And there are Aussies in it. Season 11 was 47 days, btw. I think some of the older seasons are like 50\u201355 days, so it really is grueling compared to US Survivor's 26-day format. ***Australian Survivor*** is on a massive hot-streak. Three of its last four seasons have been straight bangers, with season 11 being the best of the bunch. It just has a pace that US Survivor can't match (and I loved Survivor 46, so it's definitely on the upswing, too). It's just so epic, with a great cast of characters, and the editors really hone in on the best storylines. I *do* happen to have easy access to all the episodes, but I've only seen seasons 8, 10, and 11, so I really should go back and watch the others... Though I've heard that Australian Survivor is afflicted with the \"every other season curse,\" where the odd-numbered seasons are weaker (a trend which season 11 breaks)."

The story follows Moiraine, a member of the shadowy and influential all-female organization called the \u2018Aes Sedai' as she embarks on a dangerous, world-spanning journey with five young men and women. Moiraine's interested in these five because she believes one of them might be the reincarnation of an incredibly powerful individual, whom prophecies say will either save humanity or destroy it. The series draws on numerous elements of European and Asian culture and philosophy, most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism.<br />\u00a0</p>",

            "8-part anime on Netflix that has a really interesting hook (samurai get sent to a strange seemingly pantheistic island full of dangerous creatures) that is faintly reminiscent of Kong: Skull Island or the Annihilation book/movie on the high end. Never quite lives up to that promise, unfortunately, with the usual endless boring boss fights that mark this sub-genre, but it's worth a quick watch if you just want to turn your brain off for a bit and like anime with a bit of a surreal twist. I really enjoyed the premise of Hell's Paradise but not where it ended. I hope more will get made and it goes somewhere. I think I once wished for Made In Abyss but with older characters and it is sort like that. It's just not game of thrones so expecting that is setting yourself up for failure. It's a good show in its own right."
