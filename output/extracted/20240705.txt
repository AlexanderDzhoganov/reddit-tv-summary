Interview With The Vampire: Great sophomore season, continually impressed with the cast and acting. Faithful (mostly) to the source material as well.
Bosch: Somehow they’ve turned a police drama into something special, not quite “The Wire” or “The Shield”, but it’s up there for us.
School Spirits: A Paramount + original also airing on Netflix. The first fifteen minutes are pretty stupid, but once that passes it turns into a charming "ghost tries to solve her own murder" YA story. Fun characters, interesting twists.
The Boys: I'm finding this season pretty uninteresting, every episode feels so bloated. It's a shame because I used to really like it. Now I'm just holding out hope the final season will recapture the magic.
The Boys: It's actually bad. Homelanders facial twitches aren't enough to pad a show that is stalling for applause and not doing nearly enough to get it.
The Boys: I stopped watching the new season after a couple of episodes. It feels mediocre. I feel like they should have ended it last season itself.
The Queen's Gambit: The costumes, sets, music were on point. Anya was electric as Beth and the final confrontation with Borgov was my favorite scene from the show. Such a feel good show that somehow made me invested in Chess.
Dark Matter: It's like a dream come true for me. A show that combines the concept of a parallel universe with a mature tone and has a realistic vibe is something I've wanted to see for many years. Joel Edgerton who plays some of the main characters managed to create a clear different feel for each of them without using excessive showmanship/accessories to highlight the differences. It's a must try for fans of quality sci-fi. Also highly character driven and goes much further with the concept than I expected them to in a single season. Really good stuff.
Presumed Innocent: I finally started and watched the first 4 episodes in one sitting. Pretty damn good!
The Sopranos: there is nothing like a big plate of lasagne and a few episodes
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Currently catching up on Buffy, Buffy is so great. Enjoy!
The Shield: Currently catching up on The Shield.
Venture Bros: Currently catching up on Venture Bros. Go Team Venture! \\//
The Other Two: I have finally started watching The Other Two on Max and there hasn’t been a show that has literally made me laugh out loud in a while the way this show does repeatedly.
The Other Two: It's a cultural successor to 30 Rock, and it deserved as many seasons!
The Other Two: I loved season 3 especially, so look forward to the show getting even better!
Babylon Berlin: 2 epi releases per week and I just want to binge. Such a well done show. I’m so stoked for s4 of Babylon Berlin. It feels like I’ve been waiting forever so I can wait a little longer until all the episodes are released and then binge the hell out of them. Glad to hear the quality hasn’t dipped…that’s always a concern.
The Lazarus Project: I’m so bummed Lazarus Project was canceled
Freaks and Geeks: I got 12 episodes into before I learned that Bill was also Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley. Martin Starr is consistently great, check out Party Down! And he’s the best character in both of them!
Interview with the Vampire: I watched season 1 as more of a background show. It seemed slow at times so didn’t always grab my attention. After reading the good reviews here on season 2 I decided to give it a go and wow! Rarely do I feel shows get better with season 2 but this one definitely did. Two episodes in and I went back to give season 1 a re-watch and this time it had my full attention. Really loving this showing and it’s fast becoming a favorite that I feel will be on rotation when there’s nothing new to watch. The show has such a great rewatch value, they really are utilizing little details sprinkled around the episodes to pay it off by the time the finale rolls around. Plus a lot of plot clues are hidden or hinted at in the dialogue, so it really rewards you paying attention.
House of the Dragon: Watching season 2 weekly and loving it. Sunday’s episode looks to be a big one.
Hacks: Binging season 3. I forgot how much I missed this show. Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder’s chemistry is just so good.
Douglas is Cancelled: I was a little worried this might be one of those anti-consequence messaging shows so was wary going into it but decided to give it a chance after the trailer made it seem intriguing. I’m glad I took a chance on this one as it was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the better ITV offerings I’ve seen in years. The show nailed the balance between comedy and drama and was very satisfying despite hinting at some dark subject matter. The main cast was very good particularly the two leads Karen Gillan and Hugh Bonneville. I also liked the pacing of the show and how the plot developed in an unexpected but enthralling way. It was only 4 episodes long but that seemed the perfect amount of time needed to tell this story.
Sugar: This was OK. A modern day LA detective noir with a weird scifi twist. Collin Farrell had a good outing as John Sugar but the plot was never all that exciting. If they make more I’ll watch more but I did not love it as much as a lot of others have. Reminds me of Under the Silver Lake with its artsy style!
Blue Ridge: Meh…this was a passable old school weekly crime show. Reminded me a bit of a modern day Walker Texas Ranger but with a bit more of a rural setting. Watchable but definitely a tad forgettable.
Under the Bridge: I really enjoyed this true crime drama. It told the story tale of the murder of high schooler Reena Virk and the following investigation to catch the killers. It was a compelling tale and all the more horrifying for being based on true events. Both Riley Keogh and Lily Gladstone were as good as expected from such great actresses but I think the young cast also deserve a lot of credit as they were fantastic in their roles. A real mix of naive, vulnerable, cruel, and charismatic in equal turns. Excellent crime show.
Clipped: This was another excellent drama based on true events. This time chronicling the downfall of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after a racist video came to light. It was a fascinating story that I was completely unaware of being neither American or a basketball fan. The show mixed drama and comedy well and had fantastic performances from most of the cast. Crazy story but a real fun TV show!
The Veil: I enjoyed this spy drama. It was not quite on the level of The Old Man but it was watchable and pretty good despite some improbable moments. The leads, Elisabeth Moss and Yumna Marwan, were excellent in their roles while I felt like Josh Charles had some scene stealing moments as an obnoxious CIA agent with a penchant for rubbing folks the wrong way. It was not a perfect show and I was not super keen on the ending but on the whole this limited series still gets a big thumbs up from me.
Loki: Currently, I'm watching "Loki" and finding it captivating with its blend of intrigue, humor, and unexpected twists.
Succession: For recommendations, I'd suggest checking out "Succession" if you enjoy intense family drama with a touch of dark humor.
Ted Lasso: For recommendations, I'd suggest checking out "Ted Lasso" for a heartwarming and funny series about an American football coach in the UK.
Firefly: Farscape, one of the best “crew becomes a found family” sci fi shows.
Cowboy Bebop: Fallout, Severance, Orphan Black, Dead Like Me, Reservation Dogs (not sci fi, but a good found family vibe)
Dark Matter: It's always sunny in Philadelphia, buffy the vampire slayer and scrubs.
American Horror Story: I've been rewatching it.
Superstore: I've been rewatching it.
Glee: I just finished it.
Gossip Girl: I am now starting it.
That 70s Show: I know it's 100% nostalgia but I get a good chuckle from That 90s Show from time to time.
That 70s Show: I could watch a full series just about Red and Kitty.
Station Eleven: This show is exceptionally good at combining music, cinematography, and editing to get you intense chills/feels.
Trying: This has always been such a lovely show and Season 4 is no different. I was skeptical of the show continuing due to Season 3 wrapping everything up with a nice little bow but the time jump does wonders to breathe new life into the show and makes it feel somewhat like a soft reboot. There's new stories to tell now for subsequent seasons and if Season 4 is anything to go by (especially with that juicy ending) then the show isn't going to run out of steam any time soon.
Real Bros of Simi Valley: Originally a Facebook TV series, it moved to YouTube, and it's absolutely hilarious. It's like Trailer Park Boys moved to California. Highly recommend it for a good laugh!
Las Mesías: I'm watching a Spanish miniseries called Las Mesías (The Messiah). So far I'm around 4 episodes in and the series is incredible, there's so much intrigue and things going on in each episode. The art direction, cinematography, and use of the soundtrack is superb. It deals with things such as childhood trauma, religious fanaticism, conspiracy theories, cults, etc.
Star Trek Prodigy: Netflix just dropped season two and its even better than season one. The first handful of episodes from S1 feel like Star Wars, which was absolutely intentional to hook young viewers. After that it got better and better and more Trek in all the best ways. Season two has a different feel in that there are far less standalone episodes but it is just as good if not better than season one. Its marketed to kids but its for everyone. Yes, there are things that are obviously targeted at children but if you're a fan of Trek, even if you're a scifi fan who has never watched Trek, you will enjoy this show. Long time Trek viewers will be rewarded with tie-ins to Next Generation, Voyager, Picard, Trek Shorts, and there's even a funny mention of the Cerritos. I don't think any of that is a spoiler, its an incentive. I liked the show from the start, but can see how it may take some time for it to click with others. But it's gotten progressively better as it's gone on. This season was on another level for me. I really hope it does well enough to get a season 3 because it deserves it. Plus the set-up for a potential new story is very interesting. But even if it doesn't, it's a hell of a journey with a very satisfying ending in its own way.
Lost Girl: Just finished
Eureka: bingeing
Young Royals: We're watching Young Royals and 13 Reasons Why. Not sure why at 60+ I'm enjoying teen dramas so much, but a lot of them are very well written these days. Young people are having to deal with a lot more that we did at that age.
13 Reasons Why: I haven’t seen young royals yet so maybe I’ll give that a go but with 13 reasons why the seasons start becoming a parody of themselves. Season 1 was good and 2 was decent, I gave up soon after that.
Your Honor: Is this the series originally aired on Showtime? With Bryan Cranston?
The Boys: The writing in this season is sub-par and I'm not saying it because of politics. However I like the characters and the world so much that I started again at Season 1...
Suicide Squad: isekai
Adventures with Superman: My
Sandman: I know I’m late to the party, but I finally finished watching Sandman last night, and wow, what an incredible show! The production quality is amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy.
House of the Dragon: great
The Boys: spinning its wheel, not good
The Acolyte: 1 cool lightsaber fight, now its dragging again
We Are Lady Parts: season two was not as enjoyable as season one. I much preferred Amina as the focus, and season one was funnier and lighter.
Mozart in the Jungle: Recently found and binged on Amazon, went through all 4 seasons and was disappointed that Amazon cancelled it.
The Boys: Scenes with The Seven (and Nuemann) and Butcher are still interesting. Get the rest of "The Boys" ( i.e. Hughie, MM, Frenchie. Kimiko and Starlight ) involved however and the show becomes boring as hell quick. They're dumb and never get anything done. Prime example is the episode with Homelander being terrifying inside that lab and it's cut with scenes of whatever Hughie and Kimiko were doing. I think it's for the best they're ending the show next season and continue on a more supe-focused Gen V.
Big Little Lies: I just finished big little lies and I cant for the life of me understand the hype. The show was so boring, nothing kept me interested.
Big Little Lies: I’m with you - big little lies book was good though, imo.
Sharp Objects: I watched Sharp objects a couple of days earlier and I loooved it, it was soo good. It was a build up that really made me interested.
Heroes: Binge watching, on season 3 right now.
A Good Girls Guide to Murder: It was okay, I liked the book a lot more.
The Bear: Season 3 was okay, definitely wasn't as good as the first 2 seasons. It was just a building up season.
Dark Matter: Just ended last week and it's a great watch.
The Boys: Brilliant as usual.
Hotd: Enjoying it.
The Acolyte: The new episode was Meh. The whole show is pretty mid, but I was hoping it to be a bit better after last week's episode in which at least the fight scenes were decent.
Boys on the Boat: All are interesting depending on your mood/expectations
Homeland: +1 for Homeland. Haven’t seen anyone recommend this in years!
Golden: All are interesting depending on your mood/expectations
Elspeth: The first season ended much as I expected. Kinda reminds me of Columbo.
Star Trek Discovery: Yeah, late to the party, but worth the wait. It's well-written, well-directed, and so much eye candy.
The Traitors: Seriously, Goddess bless Alan Cumming. And his tailor. And his accent. I can't imagine this show being as good with anyone else at the helm. The twist in the final episode was extremely satisfying.
Silo: I watched five or six episodes of Silo, I really can’t understand why this show was so recommended, does it get better? It really feels drawn out. You’ll be wanting for more when you see what the last episode has in store. Silo has almost 0 soul. It isn't worth the investment imo. It's just a pretty slow show. I was also slightly annoyed by it, since you are mostly waiting for the characters to catch up to the viewer. Or they do things like try a single thing to solve something unknown, it doesn't work, and then they never bother with it again. Considering it's based on a finished book series I will stick with it, no danger of it going off the rails, and I like the setting.
The Walking Dead: Oof, I cut my losses after season nine. I could rewatch season one but that’s about it.
Catching Lightning: a Showtime docuseries about the 2006 Securitas robbery in Kent, England partially orchestrated by former UFC hopeful "Lightning" Lee Murray.
30 for 30: The Story of Faze Clan: a documentary on Hulu about Faze Clan, delving into their controversies including involvement in a crypto pump and dump scheme and running a Counter-Strike gambling service.
The Bear: Kinda curious for people who are fully caught up on The Bear. Do you feel S4 will be the last season? Honestly I almost feel like the show was initially supposed to be 3 seasons and it got stretched with this filler season. I feel like season 3 is a clear rampup to season 4 and therefore doesn't work as well as a standalone. I think they won't overstay their welcome, so 4 may well be the final season. Especially with Ayo and Jeremy's stars blowing up. I think they will for sure push for a 4th. If for nothing else just to prove that the show still has some integrity. I couldn't even get through this season and I was a die hard fan of the first two.
Sharp Objects: My initial thought was that it was going to be some kind of female centric True Detective but it's definitely it's own thing. Some incredibly subtle camera work and transitions in it that lend it it's own feel. Amy Adams is very impressive as always but here there is something that feels more personal. If I had to level a criticism it would be more to do with my bias against overuse of flashback imagery. It's the opposite of feelgood so anyone looking for an easy watch should stay away.
Furia: A Norwegian-German drama show about infiltrating and defeating right wing extremists. The show is a weird mix of things, feels like something you've watched before, and the handling of themes and subjects of right wing extremism is extremely in your face and on the nose. The villain and mastermind behind it all spews out very on the nose dialogue, to the point that it borders on being annoying. The second billed lead actor is sidelined into a minor side character in the back half of the show. The show has weird pacing and focus, passable acting, and by the numbers storytelling for most of the time, making it less than enjoyable.
Between: It's about this walled community/city wherein they are protected from the plague outside. Then they start to notice their fishes inside their city starting to die, so they start investigating what's causing this and they wonder maybe this plague was entered their city.
America's Sweethearts: I am very into behind the scenes shows specifically about sports as I have the hand-eye coordination and spatial reasoning of an undifferentiated clump of cells, so I find them fascinating. I actually have Deep ThoughtsTM about the reaction online to the older women who are running the show: the two coaches and managers and Charlotte Jones. I recently saw a TT where someone was excoriating them as horrible, awful, mean, terrible, but the only concrete example was the insistence that they be called "ma'am." I dunno, I think this is sexism and internalized misogyny with a sprinkle of ageism, frankly. I didn't see these older women cursing, insulting, or otherwise treating these younger women with anything but stern respect and having very high standards. I strongly (strongly) suspect if these were men, we would have nothing to say except that they were "geniuses" like Steve Jobs types. They are exacting and focused Type A people, so what. One of them (Kelly I believe) is directly responsible for growing the DCC into a multi million dollar org. I don't want to hear what a "bitch" she is. She's a hard nosed business-person, sure. But this take really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure it's up to Charlotte Jones per se to decide on the DCC salaries (the other area the TT-er was going on about) and it is a part time entertaiment job that 1000s of women want. I can imagine it's very difficult to peg that market rate for that job.
Also I really pity Victoria--my heart breaks for her. She's not the same kind of beautiful as the other women and clearly isn't the same personality type (ultra extroverted, bubbly, conventional/normal). Victoria the call is coming from in the house with that Grey Gardens set up you have with Mother Dearest. Blink twice girl!
Tell them you love me: Holy CRAP. Where to start. I will say this: the documentary (like all of them) has a tendency to let their subjects go unchallenged. One example is when John the older brother gets "freaked out" by the main lady/perp saying that she would "sign in blood" to be with DMan--hello John, listen to the *whole message*. It says she would sign a contract that she would **get divorced** to be with "Dman". (which...still doesn't paint her in a great light, admittedly). This kind of basic mishearing and misunderstanding reduces the credibility of the subjects, and they 100% have a case! She assaulted him! She r_ped him! It's sickening. But what's most confusing to me is how a woman her age and with her intelligence could find a man who is so *clearly* mentally compromised and like half her height and weight attractive *physically*!!! I used to work with special needs college students, I was called the "handicapped whisperer" (these were less sensitive times) because I had a knack for understanding people with severe speech and cognition struggles. I had a student ask me what I wanted and promise to get my anything I wanted--his name was Rodney and he'd been shot in the head in a gang alteraction and had permanent brain damage. I told him "you can get me the VHS tape of *L.A. Story* if you want, but nothing more expensive than that" because he had the **mind of a child**!! (He did get it and I was very touched). He was technically an adult but there was like...ZERO chance I would let him think I was interested, etc.
Vanderpump Rules: last episode of Season 11, reunion. I mean, LaLa has a point, but she is so aggressive and unable to articulate it and so self-serving that it gets lost in the bickering. I feel for Jo--Jesus CHRIST woman have some dignity. Yes, it's startling just how beautiful Tom Schwartz was at one point--he probably could have been a celebrity if he had laid off the drugs and drinking, but GIRL. It's L.A. There's 10 million of them out there. And he's nowhere near the looks he had!
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny: The latest Indiana Jones adventure is out, and people are loving it for its nostalgic feel and thrilling action scenes.
Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan’s new biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb is a must-watch. It's gripping and full of amazing performances.
Barbie: This one's fun and colorful, blending humor and heart. It's a fresh and entertaining take on the classic doll’s story.
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: Tom Cruise is back with another Mission: Impossible film. Expect incredible stunts and intense action.
Secret Invasion: Marvel's newest series focuses on the Skrull invasion of Earth, with Samuel L. Jackson returning as Nick Fury.
The Bear: This show about a young chef running a family restaurant is getting rave reviews for its storytelling and performances.
Stranger Things: The latest season of this beloved sci-fi series is here, promising more thrills and mysteries.
The Witcher: Henry Cavill is back as Geralt of Rivia in the newest season of this fantasy series, full of monster-hunting and political intrigue.
Love In A Cold Climate: if you have watched the show please upvote me!
