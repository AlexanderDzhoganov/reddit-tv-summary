Dopesick: Finally got around to watching Dopesick. Very well made, well written, well acted, and heartbreaking. Very heavy watch.
Dopesick: Yeah it was super good. The girl who plays the addict with back problems I thought was amazing. As was Peter Saarsgard as always.
Dopesick: Michael Keaton is such a treasure and gave this series his best. He was motivated to take on the role because his nephew died of a fentanyl overdose weeks after rehab.
Dopesick: Michael Keaton's story and acting is incredible. Turning from a small town doctor doing everything he can for his patients and the community (stopping by an elderly patient's home to remind them to take their evening medication), going from that to getting sucked into spiral of addiction.
Haunting of Hill House: Started with some trepidation but have well and truly tripped and fallen down the stairs with this one. Some absolutely terrifying moments here. The character arc of the twins is morbidly fascinating. The musical score is creepy and suspenseful. I am jumping at every shadow and play on light afterwards. The second or third to last episode is one of the best episodes in the last 10 years imo. Much of it is shot in one take or seamlessly portrayed as such.
Haunting of Bly Manor: Just maybe don't expect as much from Bly Manor, even if I loved it 🥲
Lost: I watched it during the original run and man it’s still awesome. The cliffhangers in Lost are still unmatched to this day. Im on epi 12, season 2.
The Boys: Might be in the minority here but I'm still enjoying the show, sure it has it's flaws and it's not the best show on tv by any means but I still find it thoroughly entertaining and can't wait for the next episode. Also, give Anthony Starr his emmy already or at the very least a nomination. Anthony Starr as Homelander is one of the all-time best villain performances I've ever seen. It's bone-chilling. Over on /r/theboys most people are complaining about Frenchie's story thus far and how it feels like out of the blue or unnecessary.
The Boys: I'm more interested in the villains than The Boys. Homelander, Deep and Noir. And I think a lot of other people think the same too, probably why they just can't kill Homelander.
The Boys: I am also still a fan though I really find the writers are so "dick" crazy! Like literally obsessed even more so than some horny directors.
Station Eleven: Through 7 episodes of Station Eleven. Love it.
Colin from Accounts: Colin from Accounts season 2 picks up right where it left off, just a great show.
Colin from Accounts: What’s the appeal of Colin from accounts?
Colin from Accounts: Colin is One of that feel good shows that don’t get enough recognition.
The Glory: A Korean show about getting revenge against a small clique who brutally bullied a woman in high school. 9/10 for me. I love seeing bullies get their comeuppance.
Itaweon Class: My favorite Netflix Korean revenge show. Wish the ending had been a little bigger however the buildup is so delicious. Love the one giant season format.
Beyond Evil: Detective drama. A detective who was previously accused of murdering his twin sister 20 years ago is thrown back into the spotlight when a hotshot detective arrives in his town.
My Name: Revenge drama. A young woman tries to avenge her father's killer.
D.P: Two men are assigned the task of tracking down deserters who flee during their military service.
My Mister: A man down on his luck befriends a young woman who is going through some turmoil in her life and they form a kinship of sorts.
The Guest: A detective, a priest, and a psychic linked together by their past join forces to unravel crime caused by supernatural forces.
Yonder: Reminiscent of Black Mirror. Feels like a long movie. A man is given the chance to reconnect with his deceased wife after her death.
King of Pigs: Told via school flashbacks and present day, two old friends are haunted by school violence they endured, one became a detective and the other a killer.
Strangers From Hell: A young man moves into an apartment share that is not all what it seems and finds himself surrounded by strange people, including an unnerving dentist.
Evilive: An ordinary, humble lawyer finds himself at the mercy of a young criminal and soon finds himself transforming into a criminal.
All Of Us Are Dead: A zombie outbreak in a high school. Primarily focuses on a group of teens who find themselves trapped in the school trying to survive. Second season will be released this year.
Narco Saints: Based around true events. An ordinary businessman is enlisted in a secret operation of the National Intelligence Service to capture a drug lord in Suriname.
Presumed Innocent: Enjoying so far
Patriot: Best show nobody knows about. Is unique and amazing!
Presumed Innocent: I knew I'd eat this up with Gyllenhaal having the lead, and I've enjoyed it so far.
Acapulco: Abolsutely adore this show. Wondering if S3 is going to be the end, it seems to be drawing near a natural conclusion. I'll miss it whenever it ends but always return for rewatches.
HotD: Really solid 1st episode. Recently read the book and it's fun to see the similarities and differences, however was a bit let down by >!blood and cheese!< and >!no scenes with Aemond telling everyone what he had done!<.
Dark Matter: Nothing ground breaking but it's given me 2 months of excitement for episodic releases and for that I'm thankful. Enjoyable show, on par with a lot of other things Apple TV has done, but not close to sniffing their best work (Severance).
Defending Jacob: I had never heard of this one, apparently it came out in 2020. Saw that it was for some reason on the top shows for Apple this past week and Chris Evans so said screw it and gave it a try. Another one that's nothing ground breaking but solid and enjoyable.
The Wire: McNulty, Bunk, Lieutenant Daniels, Ellis, and Kima are so themselves from the minute they appear on the screen to how they are remembered five seasons in. Characters are always the main focus of David Simon's shows, so they're strongly written and defined from the get-go. Great casting too, a whole lot of the Wire cast got around.
Breaking Bad: Gus Fring's Spanish in season 1 wasn't much better than an advanced college student. The actor definitely improved his Spanish through the seasons of Breaking Bad.
Star Trek: Michael Dorn just got better and better as Worf through various Star Trek shows.
Players: Watching Players by the creators of American Vandals. What a gem of a series. Its so well made.
Bojack Horseman: I watched Bojack Horseman in it's entirety while drunk out of my mind when it aired. Now rewatching it 6+ years later as a recovering boozebag, the jokes and references are much more rewarding. But the character arcs are just as dark and real. Love it
The Boys: Hughie's sideplot is so bad. It's clear they had nothing for his character this year and shoehorned in a side plot that had nothing to do with the theme of the show. Extremely bad writing, might as well be watching the plot from a day time soap.
The Boys: Him and Frenchies. I just don't give a shit about their side stories and want more main story ffs.
The Boys: This is classic "we like these actors so we have to keep them employed, even if they're no longer relevant". I like Hughie and Frenchie, but their stories are irrelevant to the question of supers.
Deep Space Nine: I long for the days of shows like DS9 and Voyager, at least those shows kept on theme. So much junk filler in modern streaming shows.
Colin from Accounts: Just watched Colin from Accounts season 2 episode 5, it's official, this is my favorite show, what an episode. I think it's the best comedy that's currently airing. Hell, it might be my favorite show I'm watching right now. I loved last season, but this one is on a whole other level. Everything just feels even tighter, funnier, breezier, sweeter. I was dying when there was a callback to the "Yvette/a vet" joke from the first season. Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer are absolute gems. I could watch this show endlessly. What a gem this show has turned out to be! Will highly recommend
Moving: a Korean drama about people with super powers. It airs on Hulu and probably Disney Plus. It's about ordinary people with powers who feel isolated and how they find others. The show starts with one character with a power that's more of a curse and introduces more characters with powers. There is international intrigue building in the subplots.
Evil: We’re really enjoying it right now. I’m kind of bummed that we’re caught up on old episodes and have to wait a week for new ones.
For All Mankind: People often equate it as kind of a prequel in a sense. It starts at the moon landing, but each season jumps about a decade, in a universe that the space race didn't stop there. It scratches the itch as an Expanse stan.
Stargate Universe: Isn't quite the same as The Expanse but is a good ride for what it is. You don't have to have seen previous Stargates to understand it.
Battlestar Galactica: Nothing on the level of The Expanse, unfortunately, but something like Battlestar Galactica might come close.
Ripley: The visuals are indeed all that - breathtaking. Ripley is an interesting character in that he is so lacking in complexity, which paradoxically makes him interesting. Andrew Scott empties himself out in his performance, and the nuances of his reactions to things are where all the fun comes out. The show often uses faces of statues as 'observers' in various shots, as Ripley would value them more than actual people. Some feel the show is about one episode too long.
The Bad Kids: Great Chinese series around 3 kids who witness and accidentally film a murder and decide to blackmail the killer. Found on Iqiyi streaming.
Interview with the Vampire: Likely the best show on TV with a small viewership. Assad Zaman shines as Armand.
Blue Lights: Good cop show from Belfast with a 2 episode premiere on BritBox.
We Are Lady Parts: a British television series created, written, and directed by . The series follows a British band named Lady Parts, which consists entirely of .
Deadwood: the end of the third season, then the movie again
The Knick: criminally underrated
Chernobyl: Chernobyl is stellar
The Responder: The Responder is a great show. I preferred the first season but season 2 is still great.
Tokyo Vice: Tokyo Vice was loved. Those last two episodes of S2 were tense. Looks like the good guys are going to lose again. Also nice to see, Jake >!Get some comeuppance for his actions. The videotape and what he did to his friend with giving away the source. And he didn't get the girl.!<
Outer Range: It spends a lot of time in weird arcs which changes the entire feel of the show, but I actually really enjoyed it. It is a solid fun-to-watch sci fi story with interesting characters and good acting. It takes a damn minute to get to the point. It is definitely a slow rolling show, and as I pointed out above it shifts focus hard on the second season leaving it feeling connected but there’s a good number of drawn out scenes that are tough to get through. If you don’t mind monologues and want a lot of intentional vagueness leaving you to fill in the blanks, it’s an interesting watch!
Presumed Innocent: I enjoyed the first 2 episodes. Good pacing and a good mystery.
Interview with the Vampire: Just binged the 1st season and wow it was incredible. Going to catch up on the 2nd season over the weekend. Really can't recommend this enough.
Dark Matter: Finished watching the 7th episode and I would say it's a pretty solid show overall. I haven't read the book so I'm not sure how well it holds up but the show definitely kept me intrigued throughout.
Death Game: It starts off with a guy going to a work interview and then watching a guy walk into traffic and getting absolutely merked by a car, and the guy basically dies in his arms. The main guy is really good at playing a down and out loser. It's sorta like Quantum Leap with a game attached.
Battlestar Galactica: Started watching the mini series and first two episodes so far. Really impressed. I love how it's not afraid to be dark. In fact I would've liked it better with the original vision, I'm seeing lots of examples of how the network forced the show runners to make it less dark. It has ups and downs with the writer's strike and the ending isn't perfect but you are in for a ride.
Blue Lights: I was sceptical of starting a police show but the characters are so likeable.
Normal People: Just binged Normal People in one sitting. I'm kind of devastated right now.
One Day at a Time: Have you watched "One day" on Netflix?
The Leftovers: Just finished it and it is one of the greatest series finale I've ever seen. Such a good show. Top 3 all time for me. Finale might be all time #1. Season 2 is my favorite season of television of all time. That final scene… 😮‍💨😪
Modern Family: I like rewatching the first episodes. MF pilot is so good!
Everybody Loves Raymond: I like rewatching the first episodes.
Patriot: Amazon has a short-run series from a few years back that is fantastic. Patriot is the ultimate hidden gem of a show. Other than the person who recommended it to me years ago, I've never met another person who has even heard of it. Criminal that it didn't get a third season, but the ending is still amazing.
Shogun: Looking forward to starting this week.
Interview with the Vampire: Show the of the year and it's not very close. If I had to rank the episodes of the season so far, this one would probably be in the bottom tier... which goes to show what an absolute insanity is the overall quality of the show. Because this episode was so so good. Next week can't come soon enough. The critics were saying that next two episodes are some of the television finest... ever. Judging by what we've seen so far, I'll inclined to believe them. If I watched season 1 episode 1 and didn't like it, do you think I just won't like the show in general or does it get considerably better?
Hacks: I abandoned this show the first time around, feeling like the plot was too on-the-nose or something, but recently picked it up again. It's so good that I binged it, and I think the S3 cliffhanger was awesome. Jean Smart is just fantastic to watch.
You're the Worst: I had to steel myself for a rewatch because this show breaks my heart. It's even better the second time around. (I'm at the start of S4.) It's funnier than I remember, and I'm embarrassingly emotionally invested in Jimmy and Gretchen.
Mr. Inbetween: One thing I like about them is how "small" these shows are, like the setting itself, the towns and stuff like that. They feel more "grounded" for the lack of a better term.
Colin From Accounts: No Activity, comedy series starring Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer from Colin From Accounts (it's how they met) - it's pretty much what the title sounds like, hardly any actual events happen in the series as it's just conversations, but it's hilarious
Rake: I thought Deadloch (crime dramedy) was fun. Glitch (paranormal) was OK if I remember (but I won't swear to it), and then Tidelands (also paranormal).
Frontliner: Rosehaven, Rake (equal best with Mr. Inbetween) and Frontliner are great Australian shows.
Deadloch: Deadloch for sure!
Underbelly: Underbelly Season 1
The Dry: The Dry - a movie with Eric Bana
Upright: In addition to the two you mentioned I can highly recommend Rake and Upright
The Tourist: Not quite as excellent but I enjoyed The Tourist.
From: I need the next season to come out.
The Shield: Finished season 2. Currently on S3E3. Consistently thrilling with plot arcs burning throughout the season. Cast is great. Walton Goggins is in the show as Shane.
Northern Exposure: Network TV show from the 90s about a Doctor from NYC navigating life in small town Alaska because he has to pay back a loan for medical school. The show is incredibly charming and filled with interesting characters. The episodes are mostly independent from one another which makes it easy to watch and so far it’s covered topics ranging from love and homosexuality to death and Russia. The first season is kind of rough as it finds its footing but really improves by season 2.
Interview with the Vampire: Last episode was spectacular, one of the best one in years. This week seems to be a big one as well. Can’t wait. I’m not ready for the season to be over in just a few weeks :(
Interview with the Vampire: The insanity of these characters is so entertaining. Loving the interview scenes this season, the interplay between Armand and Daniel is both hilarious and tense. Also Ben Daniels is an absolute treasure as Santiago.
The Outlaws: Stumbled on to it after seeing a Stephen Merchant interview. Quirky British dramady. All 3 seasons are also on BBC iPlayer.
Life: Rewatch of this classic that got cancelled too early. One of my favorites ever! The format and tone could have easily filled out like two or three more seasons. Damian Lewis was top tier but that whole cast was kind of perfect. Started on your recommendation. Pretty good! Very much a product of its time. But quirky.
Presumed Innocent: I highly recommend it.
Fallout: I've just finished watching
The Last of Us: I've just finished watching
House of the Dragon: Can't go wrong with either of those 3 shows. Personally I would say Dark > Severance >> HotD , Dark is a masterpiece but very dense though and requires a lot of concentration, should also be watched in the original German with subs for the full experience. HotD is an entertaining and easy binge with a 2nd season around the corner. Severance had a mind-bowing first season leaving a lot unanswered for the upcoming season, hoping it won't be another westworld.
DARK: Can't go wrong with either of those 3 shows. Personally I would say Dark > Severance >> HotD , Dark is a masterpiece but very dense though and requires a lot of concentration, should also be watched in the original German with subs for the full experience. HotD is an entertaining and easy binge with a 2nd season around the corner.

Ted Lasso: Interested in Ted Lasso but any other good ones on there?
Apple TV: Apple TV has a number of shows I think you should consider in addition to Severance. Sugar, Shrinking, and For all Mankind would be my top three picks with ForAll Mankind way in the front.
Slow Horses: Some of my favorites on Apple TV+ have been
Trying: Some of my favorites on Apple TV+ have been
Shrinking: Some of my favorites on Apple TV+ have been
Sugar: Some of my favorites on Apple TV+ have been
Dark Matter: Must watch! First 3 episodes might be a little slow for some but for me I was already hooked. From episode 4 onwards almost everyone just want to keep watching but we been waiting eagerly weekly
Presumed Innocent: Watched first 2 episodes. Decent. Will stay with it. See where it goes.
Dark Matter: Episode 8 sent the series to another level, best so far.
Colin from Accounts: Awaiting the next two episodes.
Foundation: Asimov didn't think much of women, and there were no significant female characters in the books. In the show, several roles are gender-bent, resulting in some great, interesting and complex female characters.
The Boys: I plan to start watching The Boys with my SO.
Bridgerton: I will take some time to watch Bridgerton.
I'm A Virgo: After seeing it pop up for however long, I finally checked out I'm A Virgo and holy shit I loved it so much. I'm not in a great place to talk more expressively, but I thought it was incredibly fun and ridiculous. I was really disappointed when I realized I was on the last episode and there's not a season 2 yet.
I'm A Virgo: Ooh, this has Jharrel Jerome who was outstanding in Moonlight and When They See Us. Might need to check out the show just based on that.
I'm A Virgo: YES! I’m a Virgo was my favorite show of last year. Funny, wierd, smart… that damn show has everything I want from a TV show.
Baby Reindeer: is wild
Law And Order SVU: Had a craving to watch Law And Order SVU and binged like 4 seasons in a weekend, it really is a perfect-for-what-it-is show. Stabler is such a ridiculously enjoyable character. I doubt I’ll go all the way up to the current seasons, but those early ones are such a great time capsule of a bygone era of both TV and New York City. Also as an aside I think Ice-T gets undue criticism for his role, and I say that as a huge fan of Body Count. Okay Season 10 is *the* best season IMHO. Just banger after banger. It's unhinged in the way only classic SVU can be. Just wait.
Preacher: A mix of a vampire/good vs. evil series set in the desert SW of the US.
Outrageous Fortune: New Zealand crime-family dramedy starring Antony Starr from The Boys, reminiscent of Shameless US and The Riches. Good throwback to the 00’s, streaming free through Prime
Offspring: Australian gem like Mr Inbetween, family drama, funny and lovely.
Mr Inbetween: Australian gem like Offspring, nobody has heard of but really good.
Station Eleven: Finished Station Eleven. Amazing. Good thing I saw it mentioned here, don't think I would have found it otherwise.
Untitled TV Show: I have to try this show again. It didn't work for me on the first try despite the fact I love Mackenzie Davis.
Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend: I honestly can't remember when I have consistently laughed so hard.
Blue Lights: Season 2 dropped on Brit Box. Watching the first 2 episodes. It's a good show.
Dark Matter: Both Dark Matter and Presumed Innocent are good watch on Apple TV
Presumed Innocent: Both Dark Matter and Presumed Innocent are good watch on Apple TV
Perry Mason: I would do bad things for Perry Mason S3. S2 was a bit of a sophomore slump mid-HBO fiasco, but it had the bones for a bounce back imo. Still sad about the cancellation.
Perry Mason: I think Matthew Rhys is one of the most underrated actors. Having said that, I've only seen him in Perry Mason and The Americans. But... he just does hard drama so well.
Perry Mason: Agreed I watched Perry mason on a whim and it was such a pleasant surprise. So sad that it didn’t get to continue.
Perry Mason: I, too, would do unforgivable things for a third (and fourth and fifth and sixth) season of Perry Mason. But I personally loved the second season even more than the first. And anecdotally, I remember not being alone in that feeling—a lot of folks here felt that the show really hit its stride.
Madam Secretary: Great show
Dark: Finished Dark, 12 Monkeys, Lost and Fringe. Can anyone recommend similar shows that scratch the itch for a slowly revealed complex mystery? Ideally more like the first two where it feels more planned out.
12 Monkeys: Currently, Dark Matter on Apple is very good and fits in there. X files is one to consider. First season is a bit rough at times but in the middle of the series it's some of the best I've ever seen. Continuum and Battlestar Galactica.
Lost: The Leftovers
Fringe: The original "The Prisoner" - original mystery box TV show (I think)
Hotel Cocaine: Watched Hotel Cocaine. OK first episode.
Colin From Accounts: Watched episode 4 of Colin From Accounts. This show reminds me of You're the Worst.
Griselda: Finished Griselda. Proper 7/10 show. Felt like an inferior version of Narcos. Rivi was the only character that stood out for me
Tokyo Vice: Completed 4 episodes of Tokyo Vice. Better than the first season so far
Arcane: Re-watching Arcane. My god, I forgot how pretty this show was. Every frame is true art.
Mr Inbetween: Just finished the final season of Mr Inbetween, am part way through season 2 of Colin From Accounts and am re-watching Freaks And Geeks.  All excellent !
Colin From Accounts: Just finished the final season of Mr Inbetween, am part way through season 2 of Colin From Accounts and am re-watching Freaks And Geeks.  All excellent !
Season 2 of Colin from accounts!? What a treat this comment was... Off to binge!
Freaks And Geeks: Just finished the final season of Mr Inbetween, am part way through season 2 of Colin From Accounts and am re-watching Freaks And Geeks.  All excellent !
Fisk: Have you already watched "Fisk" - it's a fun one kinda like Colin from Accounts.
Trying: If you haven't seen 'Trying' on Apple+, it's a goodie.
My So-Called Life: I went back and watched My So-Called Life with Claire Danes - if you want another pretty realistic high school show, it's well done.
Scavengers Reign: Finished the season and loved it! Highly recommended for any that enjoy mature focused cartoon series...it was beautiful. And I can't stop listening to the soundtrack as well. All in all a really well done show! It was a wonderful world to be drawn in to.
One Day: Absolutely devastating, 10/10.
Mrs Davis: Mrs Davis is def worth a watch, I thought it was going to be some John Wick style show but its a lot different and better than that genre. Took me a while to get around to watch it but happy I did, 7.8/10. It's just so wholesome.
Preacher: Watch Preacher also.
Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency: for anyone wondering, if you enjoyed the first season of "dirk gently" you will probably like this.
Dark Matter: Total mind fuck. Really good and enjoying the hell out of it.
Sugar: Started watching and if you like Noir, you will appreciate this.
HoTD: Rewatching season 1 as it was ages ago. Of course it is excellent, or I wouldn't be re-watching to prime up for season 2.
Goliath: Billy Bob Thornton killed it. Great cast and after season 2, it is not the Goliath you thought it was. Well done.
Battlestar Galactica: What can I say? It's back on Amazon and been jonesing to re-watch. Love this show and holds up great. Top 3 best Sci-Fi in my opinion.
House of Dragons: Solid Start !
Eric: I can see that it's well done, and as usual "La Cumberbatch" is doing a terrific job. I love the setting of 1980s NYC and the literal craft of the show is exceptional.
Succession: It just kept getting darker and more tragic and inevitable, and the delight of spending time in this world grew less until the end where you're left wanting more/feeling that it ended on exactly the right note/moment.
Couple's Therapy: I love Orna. I will watch her for as many seasons as they grace us with.
Painkiller: It feels like it's trying to be the much better Dopesick, but also be Dumb Money, Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short. Tonally all over the place and odd, doesn't quite get it right, but admittedly quite watchable.
The Valley: Holy SHIT what a masterpiece. It is absolutely riveting watching these childish assholes struggle to be adults.
Real Housewives of Dubait: The performative "I'm so great, I'm everything, darling, kiss my ass, and I'm a manic pixie dream diva" is wearisome. The barely concealed rage when they are questioned or crossed is upsetting. This show has me in its grubby little paws right now.
The Sympathizer: All in all a good show that I'm surprised wasn't discussed more here. Struggled at the beginning with the over the top style and some questionable creatives choices but it was worth pushing through as the story and characters were really interesting. I also think that the show struggled with what it's tone choices but the juggling between emotional and dark comedy was still interesting.
The Boys: Season 4 so far has been a banger imo. Really love how Amazon handle drops, 2/3 episodes on day 1 then weekly after that the way it should be with all them.
Doctor Who: The penultimate episode of this season of Doctor Who has cemented it as one of the strongest seasons of the show, despite a weaker start. The 8 episode limit has seemingly pushed them to take massive swings with every episode, with impressive results - each episode has more or less been better than the last. Friday's first part finale cliffhanger in particular is nuts and ties together the season arc in thrilling fashion. I dropped DW because Chibnall's seasons were weak despite Jodie's amazing performance. The babies episode, the trapped in edge of space and the episode with the welsh pm were the most confusing ones but I enjoyed everything else a lot. I even enjoyed the welsh pm one I just don't understand that plot at all.
Criminal Minds: I was reminiscing about the quality of some older shows like Criminal Minds compared to shows nowadays.
Supernatural: I was reminiscing about the quality of some older shows like Supernatural compared to shows nowadays.
Friends: I was reminiscing about the quality of some older shows like Friends compared to shows nowadays.
The Sopranos: HBO had some great shows during that time period. My favorites were The Sopranos.
The Wire: HBO had some great shows during that time period. My favorites were The Wire.
Six Feet Under: HBO had some great shows during that time period. My favorites were Six Feet Under.
Curb Your Enthusiasm: HBO had some great shows during that time period. My favorites were Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Deadwood: HBO had some great shows during that time period. I also liked Deadwood.
LOST: LOST.
Malcolm in the Middle: Malcolm in the Middle.
Monk: Monk.
Peep Show: Watching Season 1. I desperately needed a British comedy
Black Books: Check out if you can find it.
Black Books: Have you seen it before? It's one of the best British comedies.
12 Monkeys: Hulu dropped 12 monkeys before I was able to watch the final five episodes — anyone know where else I can find it? It isn't on anything right now. You would have to rent it or sail. Try downloading stremio app, everything free
The Boys: Finished season 1 and looking forward to continuing! Took me about 3 tries to get into it. Open to suggestions!
My Hero Academia: Catching up on. On season 6.
Avatar the Last Airbender: After watching Avatar the Last Airbender for the first time and thoroughly enjoying it, I feel like animation is a genre I've glossed over. I know Legend of Korra would be the obvious choice to start next. But what are some other animated or anime shows that are must watches? Or ones you wish you could watch again for the first time? I mention it could be anime too because I've watched Castlevania, and started Mashle, and enjoy them both.
Over the Garden Wall: It doesn't feel like Fall until I watch it
Arcane: I'll stay away from anime (too broad), cartoons, or straight up comedies (i.e. archer/bobs burgers). But as for newer "adult" animated shows, these deserve their roses:
Bojack Horseman: I'll stay away from anime (too broad), cartoons, or straight up comedies (i.e. archer/bobs burgers). But as for newer "adult" animated shows, these deserve their roses:
Primal: I'll stay away from anime (too broad), cartoons, or straight up comedies (i.e. archer/bobs burgers). But as for newer "adult" animated shows, these deserve their roses:
Pantheon: I'll stay away from anime (too broad), cartoons, or straight up comedies (i.e. archer/bobs burgers). But as for newer "adult" animated shows, these deserve their roses:
Blue Eye Samurai: I'll stay away from anime (too broad), cartoons, or straight up comedies (i.e. archer/bobs burgers). But as for newer "adult" animated shows, these deserve their roses:
Attack on Titan: Anime
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood: Anime
Vinland Saga: Anime
Mob Psycho 100: Anime
Erased: Anime
Haikyuu: Anime
Primal: Arcane and Attack on Titan
Moral Oral: I really liked Moral Oral - it may be better for us boomers who grew up with Davy and Goliath
The Simpsons: You didn't mention the Simpsons so the first 10 years or so of that
The Dragon Prince: Don’t sleep on The Dragon Prince. Aaron Ehaz was the head writer for ATLA and has done a marvelous job building another interesting world
Gravity Falls: Trying to offer some recs that haven't been suggested yet
My Adventures with Superman: Trying to offer some recs that haven't been suggested yet

KonoSuba: KonoSuba
Overlord: Overlord
Spy x Family: Spy x Family
Cautious Hero The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious: Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious
Manhunt: A pretty good albeit slow-paced series about the hunt for the killer and conspirators behind the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Tobias Menzies gives a quiet intensity to the leading role of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
The Boys: 3eps of the Boys s4, well this is kinda depressing with butcher-hughie and everyone's situation really. Still good with the emotional moments.
HOTD: Watching the boys, HOTD and acolyte week to week til the Bear comes out.
Acolyte: Watching the boys, HOTD and acolyte week to week til the Bear comes out.
House of the Dragon: Season 2 First episode, it's so good to be back. Great start!
Venture Brothers: There is a lot of humor packed into each episode.
The Boys: I've been a huge fan of The Boys and every season has ended up in the top 3 best shows of the year when it's come out. While season 4 is still good, it hasn't reached great status and has been kind of dragging. Homelander is still great as always but now it feels like he's the only character that has been good. S4 felt like 3 episodes in the middle of a season. Nothing has really happened to make it feel like this season things will be different. It just kind of continued on from the end of 3. Many characters seem to have lost the spark that made them tick, especially Starlight and MM. The only track that felt interesting and new was that of Butcher and Ryan.
House of Dragon: Enjoyed the first episode of S2 and looking forward to the rest of the season.
Resident Alien: My wife and I finished season 1 which was great. Season 2 - 4 episodes into it isn't as strong as season 1 but still good.
Presumed Innocent: Probably my favorite new show on right now.
House of the Dragon: Though I don't have Max, so can't watch.
Dark Matter: Penultimate episode was nuts. Fans are sad that the show is ending soon. Viewers are anxiously waiting for the finale, hoping for a satisfying execution. Some differences from the book have been noted in this adaptation, with additional characters and altered character roles. There are threads left dangling, sparking speculation about the possibility of another season.
Himym: sometimes I want something like Himym where I have 20+ episodes of low stakes build up with funny comedic moments.
Psych: sometimes I want something like Psych where I have 20+ episodes of low stakes build up with funny comedic moments.
Community: sometimes I want something like Community where I have 20+ episodes of low stakes build up with funny comedic moments.
Monk: most of the USA Blue Sky shows, like Monk, Psych, Suits, White Collar, etc. standardized on 16-episode seasons.
Psych: most of the USA Blue Sky shows, like Monk, Psych, Suits, White Collar, etc. standardized on 16-episode seasons.
Suits: most of the USA Blue Sky shows, like Monk, Psych, Suits, White Collar, etc. standardized on 16-episode seasons.
White Collar: most of the USA Blue Sky shows, like Monk, Psych, Suits, White Collar, etc. standardized on 16-episode seasons.
Interview with the Vampire: Easily the best show on television right now
Interview with the Vampire: OK I'll watch interview with the vampire already!
Interview with the Vampire: I got two episodes into season 1 and gave up because it was all just a bit silly. Does it get better then?
Baby Reindeer: Honestly, Baby Reindeer blew my mind. It's one of the most raw shows I've ever seen, with plenty to reflect on and consider about ones own personal flaws and our experiences with trauma. I also felt the ending was one of the best I've seen in a TV show
The Acolyte: If you're going to make a CW Star Wars show, COOL! Cut the budget and have more fun. But if you're going to make a $180 million "serious" Star Wars show, it needs to be a lot better than this. Why are the characters so forgettable?
The Boys: Christ, what did Erin Moriarty do to her poor face. If there was anyone who didn't need plastic surgery, it was her.
Meghyn Kelly: Found Meghyn Kelly's reddit account.
Breaking Bad: Rewatching Breaking Bad again and it's still so interesting.
Better Call Saul: I'll start watching Better Call Saul after this (never watched it past season 3). If you've not watched it till now because of whatever reason, I advice everyone to. There is a reason it is so heavily revered.
Clarkson's Farm: Got a 30 day free Prime offer.
Picard: Got a 30 day free Prime offer.
The Expanse: Got a 30 day free Prime offer.
Gen V: This show wasn't initially on my watchlist, but I decided to give it a try since it's connected to The Boys. In my opinion, it’s a mediocre series with a few good moments and somewhat forced cameos. I disliked some of the lead actors' performances and occasionally the writing, as it felt like the writers relied on the YA trope where opposite-gendered lead characters always end up together. Despite not being a fan, I'll continue watching anything related to The Boys universe. Rating: 7/10.
The Boys Presents Diabolical: This 8-episode animated anthology series ranges from crappy to excellent. The best part is that each episode is only about 10 minutes long, making it easy to binge-watch. Rating: 7/10.
Naruto: Seen everything 4 times also shipuuden and the movies one of my fav anime! Enjoy it mate !
The Boys: Homelander is still carrying the show, but Sister Sage character is refreshing too. The only story arc that feels a bit pointless is Frenchie, Colin, Kimiko. It feels forced to just give them something to do. It’s not a must to have a story arc for each supporting character.
Manhunt: Don’t
Manhunt: Yes, continue
Tattooist of Auschwitz: Harvey Keitel brings his true form in this. Recommended.
Bad Lieutenant: Just watched the movie, could do with some more Keitel in my life.
Ten Pound Poms: No relevant info
Hotel Cocaine: Just finished it and it is not bad. It gives me my mob show fix and always good to see Michael Chiklis back on TV.
Griselda: Not as good as it was right from the 1st episode.
Godfather of Harlem: As of Episode 4 i am 80% sure to only be watching godfather of harlem to see what giancarlo esposito does. Which is sad, because i should be interested in whitakers, d'onofrios or sorvinos character.
Malcolm X: Malcolm x is remarkably boring for being Malcolm x.
Sweet Tooth: Yes. If you liked season 1 and season 2, absolutely.
The Boys: Started watching it, fun but not like it used to be. Characters' motivations whip-sawing, except for Homelander, Ashley, The Deep, Soldier Boy, and A-Train's brother. Mainly focused on Butcher and Homelander now.
Defending Jacob: Really solid, glad it popped up on the top of Apple TV's shows this week and I gave it a chance.
Defending Jacob: Have wanted to watch this but it feels way too intense. Edge of the seat shows stress me out…
Presumed Innocent: I'm really enjoying it. I miss the vibe of 1990s legal thrillers, so this is right up my alley. And I haven't seen the original movie this is based on, so it's all fresh to me.
The Acolyte: I'm honestly confused at the massive backlash to this. Yeah I dont get it I made the mistake of looking at reviews and deciding to not watch it.  Watched it anyways and have been enjoying it so far. It's mostly right wingers that don't like having a non white male lead or lesbian witches. It's a CW Star Wars show. Not necessarily a bad thing. But I think fans want something more. I do not recommend The Acolyte to any existing fans of Star Wars.  Disney keeps co-opting existing Star Wars cannon and making it in their own way which is essentially ruining it.  Some examples from The Acolyte: Anakin's immaculate conception is supposed to be special, but The Acolyte is playing it down like it's no big deal and the witches are the ones that birthed Anakin.  Anakin was created by the force because it sensed a major imbalance.  This usually happens once every generation or so, but the kids are not always discovered.  Since Sith are the ones that like to dominate the force, they are usually the ones that cause these imbalances.  The Jedi tend to live in harmony with the force. But where a LOT of fans (like me) are pissed off with The Acolyte is that they are stealing the story of Knights of the Old Republic.  This is something that fans have desperately wanted for decades.  The premise of KOTOR is that a Sith, called Darth Revan, gets captured by Jedi and they use the force to erase his memories and then they use him as a Jedi.  Eventually Darth Revan figures out what is done to him and that he's actually evil.  It's a really really awesome story.  Many of us strongly believe that this is the direction that Disney is going with The Acolyte.  If this is true, then Disney is essentially pulling the rug out from under our feet and taking this amazing story from us.
The Boys: The Boys seems to be a case of arrested development where they tell the same story over and over again. I hope S4 can freshen things up, although the first episode does not really indicate so. This season focus is on Homelander going "evil" in public and Neuman's bid for presidency. Everything about it is so high quality, but the plot has moved inches since season 1. Recycling the same core conflict season after season and hitting the reset button towards the end of each season. The pacing of these 3 episodes was brutal.
The Boys: The Homelander plot is entirely too derivative of the Trump playbook. It's painfully obvious Homelander is carrying this show which is why they won't kill him off. Hard to keep interest when you know there's plot armor everywhere. The Frenchie/Kimiko plots are utterly pointless and the rest of the boys flip flop against themselves and each other so often that their characters are already dead. Season 3 already felt a bit stale.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine: Absolutely hilarious show with some heart-warming scenes out of nowhere. RIP, Andre Braugher.
Smiling Friends: I'm about to start after seeing how happy folks are that there will be another season.
House of the Dragon: Enjoying my fantasy-hero-scifi stuff.
Acolyte: Enjoying my fantasy-hero-scifi stuff.
The Boys: Enjoying my fantasy-hero-scifi stuff.
Presumed Innocent: Not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal in general (although I do like his acting & loved Prisoners), but I love following trials to unpack the mystery so I'm giving it a go
The Capture: Season 1 was so so great!
Severance: 10/10 on Episode 7 and it's a total 10/10 The cast/acting is incredible & Christopher Walken is in it! I also am loving the layers of the mystery of the workplace itself as we follow the new worker, and then I love the larger frame with the outside world. It's upper there with White Lotus, The Bear, and HotD for me.
HotD: 9/10 A good foundation for everything- I'm not a fan of solely build to a war type seasons, but I like that the show in general takes a more nuanced approach to good vs evil and really digs into realistic motivation and redemption choices.
The Irregulars: It's a Sherlock Holmes show from a different angle. More of a supernatural mystery.
Clipped: Watched what they have released so far (3 episodes) and just weird. Granted, I don't recall too much of happened with Sterling and his leaked racist remarks in 2013 nor am I a basketball fan but just really cheesy on one end (Doc and the team) and then just strange/odd with the rest of it (Sterling/V). Don't think I'll be watching anymore.

Renegade Nell: I slept on it, but 2 episodes in, and there is something interesting here.
Hotel Cocaine: No info
House of the Dragon: Excellent as always!
The Boys: The Boys are back in town. I'm on the still greatly entertained team. It's giving me what I want and expect from the show.
The Boys: I’m loving it still. Can’t wait to see the brigading from people saying it’s woke and shit, especially the ones that changed their pfp to homelander in the past haha
EVIL: Great episode, hoping they only do one or two more procedural episodes so they can tie everything up nicely for the endgame.
Game of Thrones: Rewatched first 4 episodes of GOT. It is definitely very rushed and some things didn't make sense (such as how easily castles are taken over etc) but it still feels like a good quality show tbh. The tension between Jon and Daenerys, Sansa slowly coming in charge of Winterfell, Cersei's and Dany's armies waging various battles etc all are interesting. The controversial 6th episode is to come and I think that really harms the repute of S7.
Smiling Friends: New season is hilarious, one of the best shows Adult Swim has done
New Girl: Started watching new girl again, on season 3 right now
Futurama: watching that and Futurama when i need something to have
The Great North: might start watching The Great North again as well as another one to have on
Tiny Beautiful Things: Anyone watched Tiny Beautiful Things? Looking for a more serious or actual show to watch now
Rebus: I really enjoyed this Edinburgh set crime thriller. Gritty and engaging with some fun twists and turns and interesting characters. I’m not always a fan of British shows but this is definitely one of the best I’ve seen in a while. I’ve not read the books but I’ll absolutely have to give them a go now! Started rebus, the acting is god awful. Maybe it’s just me or they hated doing retakes
Hierarchy: This was a fun twisty YA K-Drama. It was like a Korean Gossip Girl packed with plenty of nonsense and melodrama. Only thing I hated was the way nothing really got wrapped up and they ended the show on a bit of a cliffhanger despite this being billed as a limited series.
30 Rock: (2006), rewatching and the writing it so good.
Los Espookys: (2024), new show from Julio Torres of Los Espookys, very surreal and weird.
Fleabag: (2020), UK comedy, semi autobiographical.
Taskmaster: (2024), useless clip show.
Forged in Fire: I would love recommendations for something like Forged in Fire. Not about metal working specifically, just an interesting show about something I probably don't know anything about. It doesn't have to be competition based but that's fine too.
Blown Away: Glass blowing contest.
Face Off: Special FX makeup competition. Lots of seasons available and the challenges are incredible. Amazing artistry. And some really cool guest judges for each episode.
Next in Fashion: Amateur fashion designer elimination show.
Life Below Zero: This one is one of my guilty pleasures. I like to watch it when I’m falling asleep. I think it’s only interesting to me because I grew up in a humid tropical location. It’s not a competition show but follows the daily life of a select group of people living throughout Alaska.
Glow Up: A great one with a similar feeling to Forged in Fire and Blown Away.
The Great Pottery Throwdown: It’s a UK show where amateur potters compete in challenges. Really wholesome and fun. Some seasons are on Max.
Alone: The best reality TV show ever made. Glad it's back.
The Boys: it's far from bad, but it's not as tight as it used to be. We'll see how it evolves.
The Boys: episode 4 was really good!
The Boys: where the hell is gus fring. I loved his character. Million times better than star wars acolyte.
Andor: Finished Andor. I wonder if this is Tony Gilroy's way of sneek fixing all the character issues with Rogue One. Cassian is gonna have to meet the rest of the crew at some point and all those people have stories they need fixing. Agreed - the story of Rogue One did not move me at all (too much Darth Vader being an awesome badass, not enough character beats for our heroes) and yet I found Cassian immediately compelling once he was given more to work with in Andor.
Interview With the Vampire: Season 2 keeps going from strength to strength, with episode 5 a bravura chamber piece showcasing impeccable writing and a quartet of captivating performers. Spellbinding, scary, amusing, it's a series in its own class.
NuNuWho: Russel T. Davies woefully misjudged "reinterpretation" of the show for an American Disney+ audience, that's bereft of any of the mystique and charm it once held back when he first took up the mantle practically 20 years ago.
House of Dragons: Not sure why House of Dragons gets so much hate.
Bosch: Watching season 4. Mid season surprise. Tight police drama, keeps improving.
Presumed Innocent: The Watch podcast was very high on this show, so I re-subbed to Apple. Definitely a must-see, but I do feel like a sucker paying $10/month to a service with such a small library. I suppose there's also Trying and then in August, Pachinko. When are we getting Severance and Tehran?
Acolyte: More mid-tier Star Wars. Episode 3 was my last. When is Andor coming?
House of the Dragon: Of course.
The Bear: TV is dead to me until The Bear in a couple of weeks.
Bosch: Watched all of season one this week during some summer insomnia. I was drawn to it because I loved Titus Welliver in Lost and Annie Wersching in 24. It's the most beige, mediocre show I've seen in some time. It's not terrible, it's just not great and it's baffling it ran for so many seasons. "A cop show for Dad's in their mid 50s" is one review I saw and it kinda sums it up. Bosch is pretty much on point for the source material. It's a "safe"/junkfood cop drama with a good ensemble cast...like Law and Order but stretched out to a full season rather than episodic. Bosch is really a slow-burn show that's only interesting when you watch the entire season. There's a lot of "filler" time, which I think is really intentional since they have it through all seasons and in the spinoff. I watched Bosch S1 way back when it started and it was actually quite good. The pilot of Bosch and the man in the high castle was 2 of the 5 pilot up for voting by audiences then and those 2 got the most votes. I did like Bosch S1 and I came back for S2 however S2 bored me so much I stopped and never went back. I was so surprised it went on for so long.
Presumed Innocent: This was much better with Jake Gyllenhaal on good form as always. I **think** I saw the 1990 Harrison Ford film that covers the same book years ago. Two episodes so far on Apple TV and I'd have gladly binged all the season this week (instead of the beige Bosch). As an added bonus the very good Peter Sarsgaard plays a key role too. 7/10 so far. I'm guessing that the whole thing is spoiled if you have seen the 1990 version? I saw it and remember the details. I've just watched the 2 currently available episodes of Presumed Innocent. Really liking it.
Banshee: Just watched Banshee, Ghosts UK, the most recent season of Murdoch Mysteries, and am currently watching The Shield. All very good.

The Acolyte: Will watch the week it is release, sometimes a day later
We are Lady Parts: Just finished. Good show and ended well.
Sweet Tooth: Just finished. Struggled to finish it. S3 probably the worse.
Presumed Innocent: The swimming scenes remind me of Don Draper, there are some parallels in the story to Mad Men. The show is great so far but it might be predictable.
Breaking Bad: Rewatched and found it to be so good. El Camino was watched after and currently watching Better Call Saul (upto Season 3) for first time. The writing is much better and fleshed out more.
Better Call Saul: Currently watching (upto Season 3) for first time and the writing is much better and fleshed out more. Also mentioned in comparison to Breaking Bad.
Suits: Not close to Better Call Saul in quality. Enjoyed the first 3-4 seasons but found it tedious after that. Thought it might be about lawyer/technical stuff.
The Bureau, The Americans, Patriot, Unbelievable, The Killing, Killing Eve, Succession, Slow Horses: Some show suggestions similar to Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.
True Detective: Recommended for great writing, acting, attention to detail, and rewarding for thoughtful viewing.
Mad Men, The Wire, Early seasons of Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Fargo: Recommended for great writing, acting, attention to detail, and rewarding for thoughtful viewing.
Dark Matter: To anyone who likes good scifi Dark Matter is pretty amazing. I heard Dark Matter is a bit of a slog? Really enjoying it so far. Can’t wait to see what happens next episode.
Acolyte: If you like shitty scifi there's also Acolyte
The Boys: Anthony Starr is just spectacular in this role and its great the show gives him so much good material to work with. Karl Urban had some great moments too especially in episode 3. I will always be a fan because despite shortcomings, it just has too many good actors and awesome stuff.
The Boys: hatewatching. Such a weird show, just everything is so disconnected. They are so much in love with their world building that it nearly feels smug how much they love to do give examples of how fucked up the world is, but it's mostly all just 1:1 shit that has actually happened IRL so it just feels lazy and outdated. Then they throw in some weird unnecessary gore or haha penis scene (sauna, ice skating rink) as if they need some edgy scene quota each episode, which just cheapens the whole thing. Like, what kind of show are you trying to be? Obviously it's been a while since the last season so I'm a bit rusty, but what the fuck is everyone's motivation even? So many players and everyone seems to have a different goal, and they all seem to change randomly. Then sure, why not give Frenchie and Mute Girl some NEW thing this last episode because we didn't have enough plot threads already. And Sage? Just comes out of nowhere and goes from not wanting to do anything with the whole complex to suddenly pulling the strings on it all for... reasons I guess. Someone else already pointed out how little Hughie has to do which is kind of funny. Whenever he shows up I'm like "Oh yeah, that dude used to be the main character, no ?" Also does Butcher's accent keep getting worse? Feels like a cheap parody at this point.
House of the Dragon: Too early for House of the Dragon so Ultraman Rising it is. The animation is smoooth.

Sarabhai vs Sarabhai: Can anyone recommend me shows like Sarabhai vs Sarabhai?
Castle: I think I dropped it after season 6 a few years ago. I think I just ran out of episodes and never went back to it. Well, I'm rewatching it all, and I'm almost at the end of season 7. Have enjoyed most of the Castle as a private investigator episodes. Doing it that way brought back the competitive tension from before Castle and Beckett started dating. Even if it's just temporary, it made for some pretty great episodes. If the show lands the finale, I could see this being good for an occasional rewatch.
Castle: I've been rewatching Castle/Beckett clips recently especially from the 1st 4 seasons. Think I'll rewatch the whole show soon. Amazing chemistry.
dark matter: The governing concept of the show is that each decision you make is essentially a fork in the road you come to which creates (at least) two new realities. So of course we know in one world he decides to drop his studies and have a kid and  in another world he decides to commit himself to work and research. Along that same thought process, each time he’s in the box he has a decision to go through the door, pass by to the next door, and so on. Once through the door, he also has a decision to stay in the new world or go back to the box and try again. Each decision he’s faced with in the box creates two new realities though….the reality he enters into and experiences and the reality that he doesn’t enter into but a different version of him chooses and experiences. So in that sense, the different realities that are created are constantly ongoing and infinite. The versions of him that went through a different door can still make their way back to the box and end up in the original reality where he is
The Boys: Watch the first three episodes of the boys last night and comparatively I think the first three episodes a season 4 are way better than the first three of season 3
Mr and Mrs Smith: Reminds me of The Americans because of the similar premise and high quality, well written.
Presumed Innocent: After reading that variety review last week you would think they were paid for the review as the show so far isn’t the enthralling experience they make it out to be. It isn’t bad by any means and is watchable show but dialogues/scripts fall short at times with certain scenes not feeling natural. I would give it 6/7 out of 10 so far.
Turner and Hooch: it's sooo unbelievably dumb but I love the dog so much I'm going to stick with it. I love his frowny face, globbering cutie and pretty eyes. ETA: Hooch, Carra Patterson and X are cool
Reginald The Vampire: Premise is great! Reminds me of The Vampire Accountant Fred (books) but the execution is SHYTE. The acting is so bad they could cast non-actors to do a better job. The best acting has come from Mike, Ashley, The jogger dude Reginald tried to eat in the park and at times Angela but most of the time she's a miss not a hit. The leads, Maurice, Sarah - their acting is subpar at best and cringe in general. There are a ton of filler nonsense scenes of utter unimportance and feels like the writers binge-watched every episode of VD and tried to be edgy and do the exact opposite. Pity, this could have been epic like WWDITS with a little cult following and memes for every occasion.
Raised by Wolves: Earth is in decline so to ensure mankind’s survival, fast ships are sent out containing pairs of androids and banks of human embryos, with the intent that they find habitable planets and then incubate and raise new humans there. Earth humans also migrate to the stars but in much bigger slower ships. The story begins with two of those androids, Mother and Father, raising a generation of post-Earth humans on a distant planet, and receiving a slow ship of Earth visitors who don’t approve of how androids are raising people.
Severance: Follows a workplace where people have agreed to have their brains “severed” so at work they have no memories of their outside life and out of work they have no memories of their work life. But then each half of themselves becomes curious about the other, and why this was necessary.
The Good Doctor: Final season of the series. I've been watching this since it started airing so sad to see it go. This season was overall pretty good. I liked seeing Sean and Lea navigate early parenting. I thought there struggles were realistic and the show handled there being drama there well without either character showing a lack of respect for the other or there ever being a moment where it looked like they would break up. The new characters introduced was a nice take but honestly I found Charlie to be obnoxious for the first half of the season. She was constantly causing issues by interrupting during medical emergencies and would refuse to listen to any criticism. Then suddenly halfway through the season it felt like she had a bit of a turnaround and everything was reconciled in a single episode then it was fine after that. Glassman taking in a drug addict drove me nuts and felt avoidable. By the end of the season I came around though and understood that it is more about him wanting to do something good and try to make amends for what happened to his daughter. Honestly I got the impression that the writers were told this was the final season halfway or 2/3 through the season because it felt like the season was setting up a lot of plotlines then quickly ramped up to wrapping up plotlines and resolving things right in the last few episodes. I thought the series finale was well done. I liked the time jump with Sean. Funny enough I think he committed a HIPA violation in his TED talk though by showing the names of every patient he has treated (unless he reached out to and got approval from every single one which I doubt). Anyway, good season and good show. Not always perfect but I think the drama about autism's representation in the series is overblown. Yes it doesn't represent all autistic people but no show could. I think it is a fair representation of what some people experience who are higher functioning.
The Boys: Season 4 is even less subtle than season 3. Can't believe I'm saying this but Gen V was better. I'm literally not even wanting to watch it. After reading how "bad" this season is (and I don't mean quality", I'm side-eyeing it and have seen half the first episode. Like - I love the realistic view of Supes the show gives. But I don't have to be grossed out every episode. And I have a strong stomach. The severity takes me out of the immersion.
This Boys: This boys season is ass
Gen V: Gen V was so much better.
The Boys: This season is wayyyyyyyy on the nose. Each season gets less subtle and subtle which at some point is getting old when the story is not advancing in a meaningful way. Huey’s and Frenchie’s side stories are just so boring. And Sister Sage is way too annoying to be such a prevalent character. Although I do find it comical that some people weren’t aware of the symbology until they beat them over the head with it this season. Shows the intelligence of some of these people. This season is wayyyyyyyy on the nose. Gotta be to make the right-wingers understand they are being criticized. It’s an entertaining watch but solely because of Homelander and his antics. Everything else is meh and I feel like the plot has just been stale for a while now. I actually really like Sister Sage, I don’t think she’s a bad character at all.
Doctor Who: Ncuti Gatwa continues his crying streak, probably marking him as, at best, the most outwardly distraught, and at worst the most hysterical, version of the Doctor we've ever seen. Last week's episode was a parody of *Bridgerton*, which I had not heard of before because I don't watch British aristocratic dramas, but I've absorbed enough information from pop culture osmosis to know about *Downton Abbey* and such, so I can appreciate the effort they put into the episode. Gay people aren't new to *Doctor Who*, even if the Internet culture war is trying to tell you that; Captain Jack was super bisexual, the Doctor had his moments, there were lesbians, etc. I was not a fan of the main villains though, because it reminded me of the Agatha Christie episode with the giant alien bee, but that's a personal gripe because I was far more interesting in episodes like *The Impossible Planet* or *Midnight* with more "cerebral" villains.
The Acolyte: As the most diehard *Star Wars* fan on the planet, the first thing I can say about this show is that it is very intriguing; it feels very similar to *Andor* in that I was apprehensive about it, but as the episodes came out and the picture began to solidify, I can really appreciate a bit of the slow burn mystery surrounding Osha and Mae, and what the Jedi did 16 years ago. The entire production is very well made, you can definitely tell they were smart with their money because the sets are great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, etc; the only technical flaw I can think of is >!Torbin's horrible fake beard!< in Episode 2, but that's par for the course with fake beards in *Star Wars* lmao. On the whole everyone is trying really hard and putting in the effort here and it shows. I must say that as the biggest SW fan ever, I have to concede that others might not be interested in this show for whatever reason; I like this show because it's finally showing, in a good and proper way, the politics and follies of the Jedi Order and how they fell from grace by the time of the Prequels, which of course led to their own destruction. These Jedi are obviously flawed, but they're not as robotic and callous like they were in the Prequels, *but you can see the inklings of that developing*. The mystery that underpins the whole plot is directly and thematically tied to this idea, **but if you don't care about that you probably won't care about this show**. A bunch of ragebait culture war vids on Youtube say that Episode 3 has destroyed the Force or something, and that's just because >!two lesbian witches had twins using the Force to do IVF or something!<, which isn't new information in the lore because that's how some of the Nightsisters made kids, and other Force-Sensitive sects do exist in the galaxy. **People wanted to hate this show the minute it was announced**, and so unfortunately any criticisms I see tend to be entirely subjective and most of the time downright sexist/bigoted/hateful in general, just because the main characters are female PoC, as well as the director/creator being a woman too. People are also now complaining about there being fire in space, which has always been there in *Star Wars*; if you're looking at this show and **nitpicking everything that you never did with other parts of the franchise**, ***are you being critical or are you being biased against it?*** I'll try to provide some objective criticism here: I think that the show is relying heavily on a few tropes that maybe have gone out of fashion for a reason. The idea of a >!good and evil twin!< is tired. I also think that this show will probably benefit from rewatching, since the mystery and flashbacks still have to unfold, so these early episodes at this point are filled with questions, character decisions, and dialogue that may or may not be payoffs in the end, and we don't have all the information yet, so sometimes these decisions seem overly contrived for the story.
The Boys: The Boys season 4 so far is awful. Absolute trash. If this is a final season, I would have rather they ended it in season 3, because it is looking like a bad way to go, like many other shows that started good and ended shit. It’s not the final season, the fifth one will be, though. They just announced that the other day. It’s a time filler. It’s not as deep as everyone is making it out to be. Some shows fizzle out, The Boys has been one of them but I’ll still see it through. Noped out halfway through the 1st episode. It's the same thing again and again. Hughie's side plot might as well be written for "days of our lives" It's so bad. My main problem with the show is that I don’t understand why they’re not killing each other. Character motivations are so off to me. Like why is sister Sage okay with being a villain?
Doctor Who: Latest episode has to be one of the best big bad villain entrances so far. Really loved that. As someone who watched classic who it was nice to see the references.
Game Of Thrones: I know Im late to the party, but
The Thick Of It: Is the thick of it worth watching? I have BritBox until next Friday.
Bridgerton: Bridgerton 3 is suffering from a bit of the Downton Abbey flu. Too many scenes in staid, airless rooms gives it a bit of a claustrophobic feel when Season 1 felt like an expansive playground for romance, even though the writing has never been that great. The primary emotions of the characters this season are anxiety and/or resentment, and it just isn't a fun romp any more. Nicola is doing a good job, but I'm likely going to tap out before the last ep. Also, the Viscount's wife's younger sister just seems to have disappeared.
Normal People: Finally checked out Normal People, and am halfway through. Very well directed. Totally get the raves for Mescal's understated approach to his character.
The Ultimatum: The Ultimatum (France and South Africa) - Surprisingly good. I think some of the younger couples in entertainment fields were plants, though. Nkateko should have been smarter...
The Bureau: The Bureau (French espionage) is the best spy show or movie ever made. Recommend this to anyone who is open to foreign shows
Zero Zero Zero: Okay I'm about to shove Zero Zero Zero down your throat like I do at every possible chance. Absolute *masterpiece* of a show and in my top 5 of *all time*.
Vida: Also consider Vida, a beautiful show about two Latina women navigating life and love in L.A. after their mother's death--funny, quiet, touching, interesting, compelling and stylish.
Spiral: Spiral!
Death's Game: That second episode of Death's Game is so satisfying when the kid takes a fuckin chair to his bully's noggin. Just like 1,2,3 BOW, BITCH! HOW YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF EDUCATION? He wasn't paying attention to keeping the other guy down though. If he gained his abilities of the guy he's in he should have known there were three. I don't know how anyone got away scot free on that one. But at that point he's gotta go knives on these kids asses. Do some push ups and chin ups, kid! In no time you'll be able to suplex those mother fuckers. Woooo. This shit rocked.
Weak Hero Class 1: If you’re liking the bullying arc this much, then I have to recommend **Weak Hero Class 1** for you next. It has some really satisfying bully revenge and edge-of-your-seat action scenes.
The Boys: I haven't watched any of the new season and I don't really intend to after what I considered a pretty weak showing in the recent season. Is this just a few stupid people on Twitter who journalists then magnify and pretend represent some larger group? It's less about "Homelander suddenly being a bad guy" and more "the people that agreed with Homelander *in the show* started to look more like them." The show mocks a lot of things that are considered right-wing in the new episodes released.
The Boys: At least here in Brazil, I've seen tons of comments on Facebook and Twitter about the show going overtly woke in the recent season.
The Boys: The >!ice rink!< scene was bananas. It's just taking time to develop the plot I guess? Looking forward to seeing what Sage is cooking.
Fallout: Well made series, but NMCOT, still solid 7/10
Mr. and Mrs Smith: Ep 1 initial thoughts are how refreshing it is to see actors not overacting and overdramatising every moment. It's what's kept me watching past the first 10 min. It's so shocking to see the right actors cast for their role for a change.
Dumb Money: I.e., Mr and Mrs Smith.
Bridgerton: Catching up on Bridgerton. It’s definitely something. I’m not too happy with how this season was handled, but as someone who was never a big fan of Penelope and Colin as a couple, I’m glad that they didn’t focus so much on them. Interested to see where they will go in the future.
House of the Dragon: the porn frescoes on every wall of the Red Keep is kind of weird. I guess the Targaryens are the coomers of Westeros.
Better Call Saul: I really like action/drama but I'm incredibly tired of seeing one-dimensional Strong Male Leads with no character depth. One of the reasons I loved Better Call Saul was that he was relateable in his confidence, failures, successes, romance, etc.
Banshee: Currently watching Banshee. How far into Banshee are you?? Hood ends up having alot of depth
Mr Robot: Mr Robot is a pretty intense drama thriller, the main character is pretty relatable to anybody who has depression or anxiety
The Americans: Recommendations for fast-paced action/drama shows with relatable/complex leads? The Americans.
The Boys: Weeks of negative reviews for only for them to release what is arguably their best hour with episode 4. High octane and multiple “did that just happen” moments. Anthony Starr deserves every bit of the Emmy I hope he wins after that performance 👏👏👏
The Boys: season 4 episode 4 is a great one!
Under the Bridge: I'm trying to decide whether this show is meaningless dribble. Seeing as though none of the characters are particularly likable, I'm thinking yes. Actually I'm repulsed by these girls.
Under the Bridge: I watch a buttload of crime thrillers about murders, and I'm usually pretty easy to please... But I just didn't like this show. I didn't find anyone very likeable, and I *loathed* those girls.
Under the Bridge: Maybe this is why I really don't like watching series based on true stories about murders, because they're usually just so depressing. And the "why" is never satisfying, because in real life there could never be a satisfying reason to murder someone. But with a fictional murder, I can "enjoy" the show because I know the events never actually happened. But, boy, this show... Super depressing and frustrating that it's (mostly) true.
Under the Banner of Heaven: Honestly, I felt the same about this show, where I can see that it's a quality series, but given it was based on a true story, it's just too harrowing for me to enjoy.
Under the Banner of Heaven: I thought is was okayish. I did finish it but was not impressed either.
Dark Matter: It kind of starts with a similar premise to Awake, but it quickly turns into a sci-fi thriller and explores larger concepts other than "guy waking up in the wrong life". That part only lasts for the first couple episodes. This is based off of a completed book.
Acolyte: Acolyte is doing some bold moves. I honestly thought (esp toy selling wise) the wookie would be more present in the show. But nope. I thought they would drag turning mae but looks like they are going in different direction, the biggest thing they could do is kill off a twin next bit I don’t think they’re that bold. Though it’s kinda obvious we got some red shirts in the group atm. They are not surviving the fight in the next episode. I do need the show to unravel lore a bit more though. Like I am enjoying the characters but Star Wars is a ‘give me pieces of lore to learn about’ kinda universe imo. Next episode is going to be that point if they smartly reveal something or not
Peaky Blinders: Finished Peaky Blinders and I've never been more satisfied with the ending of a show. Knowing there's a movie coming is such a great feeling. Usually it's a bit sad coming to the end of a series you love. I'm lucky I waited so long to watch it.
Interview with the Vampire: Started out strong but a bit too much tortured angsty love in the latter half of season one. Think we'll continue but also not sure the missus is that fussed and it's normally her call for shows like this.
Psych: It popped up on Netflix and thought we'd finally check it as some light entertainment and oh boy is it very 00s. Main character might get better but I don't think we're going to push through. Psych is great and hilarious but yeah a bit dated now
Beyond Skinwalker Ranch: Most convincing, science-based, measurements-based analysis of UFO evidence led by an ex CIA agent (who you might’ve seen on YouTube) and investigative journalist.
Star Wars: characters are boring
Star Wars: They needed to get more different takes for the acting. The first two episodes were watchable but a little cringe at parts. Episode three was really bad and felt like a background story recap on top of that. Episode four was kind of good even though again, they needed to get better takes for line delivery. Episode four was also too short and is obviously half of a segment. They need to start shooting these like television series.
Star Wars: It's not the most exciting show but it does have things I am interested in, such as the High Republic time period. It's nowhere near as strong as Andor or Mando, but it's also an unfinished series atm. It might be good once the entire story is out but for now it's just okay. But it does give me hope for >!Darth Bortles!<
No relevant info.
The Boys: "I love the dark humor in The Boys, definitely not your typical superhero show."
Dark Matter: "Dark Matter had such an interesting premise, it's a shame it got canceled too soon."
Doctor Who: "Doctor Who is a classic sci-fi show with such a rich history, I love how they keep reinventing the character."
My Adventures with Superman: "My Adventures with Superman looks like a fun and light-hearted take on the superhero genre, can't wait to watch it."
Manifest: First season was fresh and awesome. 2nd season started to fade. I struggle to finished the final season. The ending to me was really not very good. Similar to manifest and both seems unable to provide a good answer hence goes into mythical mode.
The Bad Seed: The movie "The Bad Seed" (2018) is a remake of the movie "The Bad Seed" (1956) where actress Patty McCormack plays the same role in both versions. There is also a sequel titled "The Bad Seed Returns."
Coronation Street: Ken Barlow holds the record for appearing in Coronation Street from the 1st season (1960) continuously until 2023.
Warrior: First 2-3 episodes feel slow but once all characters are established, it feels fast moving
Get Shorty, maybe.
Special Ops Lioness
Killing Eve
Legion
Utopia
Barry! Applying that quality storytelling and film-making of golden age television to a 30 minute "comedy" series format. Each season flies by and will really grip you.
Burn Notice: I've recently watched Burn Notice, Desperate Housewives, and Band of Brothers--and it's crazy how much more I love these shows over newer, higher-budget shows.

Band of Brothers: I've recently watched Burn Notice, Desperate Housewives, and Band of Brothers--and it's crazy how much more I love these shows over newer, higher-budget shows.
Acolyte: The 3rd episode is soo boring. The newest episode was like 6/10, but had a ending maybe worth watching more. Episodes are so short, like 22mins ish, worth waiting for season to end before starting it.
Boys: Only haven't enjoyed frenchies plot. Thought it was so good after the first 2 episodes, then went online to see all the 'controversy'. Thought Boys was always a bit South Park, except some of the stuff they are making fun of now in the Boys, is a bit out of date. EDIT: Homelander's actor definitely deserves an award. The acting is sooo good. Solid character too.
House of Dragons: Bit too early to be complaining. Too much dialogue, too much dialogue. I completely forgot what happened in S1. I like watching TV too much to not watch the of the season though.
Dark Matter: I'd still continue with Dark matter! I felt the same way after episode 1 and don't even know why I watched the second, but then it really grabbed me. It might surprise you and be a little less cliche as you think now ;)
Tokyo Vice: I think I'm hate watching at this point. If it was more than 2 seasons, I would have dropped it but might as well watch the final 3 episodes. What didn't you like about, Tokyo Vice. Definitely a slow burn until the last few episodes of each season. I liked the look at behind the scenes of the Yakuza. Yeah, Jake can be a bit much. He'll throw you under a bus to get that byline.
Banshee: In S2 of Banshee - It's funny watching Anthony Starr in this and The Boys at the same time. I didn't know him prior to Homelander, what a unique face. Prime Cinemax show, violence and nudity galore, nothing wrong with that. It's funny when he pulls out the angry Homelander voice in Banshee.
Presumed Innocent: Dialogue is terribly bland and formulaic, the scenes play out like some cheap B-movie, and all the actors seem like they're sorta phoning it in. Very sleek production quality but there's something very sterile and lifeless about the whole thing - it lacks the intellect, atmosphere, and gritty intrigue of shows like True Detective and The Night Of.
The Night Of: It lacks the intellect, atmosphere, and gritty intrigue of shows like True Detective.
House of the Dragon: Decent episode. I am liking how they are handling Aegon II so far this season. But I have to say B&C completely disappointed me. There was no tension and it felt rushed. It has nothing on the book version that's for sure. Also, Alicent in the show is a completely different character to the book. I despise the "hypocritical" route they took for her character. My view of Alicent was that she was someone who did everything that was expected of her and the tragedy of her character was that she could do pretty much everything right yet still end up sad, bitter and alone at the end. The show can no longer provide that ending for her now with the same impact as the book.
The Boys: People praising episode 4 like crazy but I feel like the only good parts were Homelander and A-Train's scenes. Also, for Homelander it kinda felt like a been there done that with him going back to where things started in S1 already. Still the best episode of the season so far. The shock value scenes felt much better placed this episode.
Homeland: Definitely a weaker season but, last three episodes were great. The finale with Brody having to get out of the Iranian government building after killing the high ranking official was tense. The final shot was sad but perfect ending. Now on to S4.
Utopia: The Aussie workplace comedy. Very funny and great cast. The scene of trying to get the laptop screen to show on the TV was the hardest I've laughed in a long time.
Masterchef: Cooking Chicken Skins in the microwave. I didn't know that but, I also don't want food poisoning.
Game of Thrones: A cartoon villain rewatching got season 7 to bathe in societys tears
