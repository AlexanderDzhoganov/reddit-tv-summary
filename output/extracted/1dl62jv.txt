The Sopranos: I finally started The Sopranos for the first time. Obviously I don't have too many thoughts yet but I can understand why this was the start of "prestige tv" as we know it. Even now, a lot of this stuff feels timeless. I am so jealous that you’re able to watch sopranos for your first time ever. Buckle up for the best tv series ever made.
Presumed Innocent: has been excellent so far.
Ripley: Ripley on Netflix is astoundingly good. The cinematography is just >chef's kiss<. The composition is impeccable. They made me duck with the scuttling the boat scene. The showrunner is The Night Of's Steven Zaillian, who's pulling off both directing and writing every single episode. Netflix promoted it as a miniseries, but Zaillian's original plan was to attempt adapting all five of Patricia Highsmith's "Tom Ripley" novels. John Malkovich popped up with such a tiny role (that character becomes much more central in the second book).
The Expanse: Currently, I started watching The Expanse after reading the first book in the series Leviathan Wakes (which is also the name of the Season 1 finale). It’s just as good as the book. Nice, have fun! I think the series keeps getting better after each season and has some of the most thrilling, tense scenes in TV history.
Detroiters: Decided to give this show a try after seeing it recommended here. Wow. I haven't laughed this much since Cunk on Earth. The characters are likeable and natural. And someone on the writing team must be from Michigan!
Detroiters: Detroiters was such a great show! Both Tim and Sam are from Detroit - such a fun show! Check out Tim Robinson's sketch show on Netflix, I Think You Should Leave, if you haven't had the opportunity.
Mononoke: really unique art style kind of like woodblock art, very colorful. It was recently remastered so I could finally watch it in good quality when it came to netflix. Definitely a classic. It's basically short stories about a guy who exorcises demons by discovering the circumstances of the curse. I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix. And there's a new movie coming out next month for the 15th anniversary that looks
Sonny Boy: this is one of those trippy confusing shows with a non-linear timeline. It's about kids that end up in an alternate world/reality in a sort of Everything Everywhere All at Once sort of way. It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it.
Interview with the Vampire: The TV Series: Aside from what everybody else has said about this weeks Interview with the Vampire, I have to say I've never seen a show play around with unreliable narration to this extent and actually pull it off. It's a fine line to walk between intriguing and gripping the audience, and frustrating the audience, making them lose investment in what's happening because none of it could be what actually happened, and so far the show has succeeded at the former. This episode in particular showed some of the most important scenes of season one through Lestat's POV and seeing just how different things went down compared to what we initially shown is just fascinating. Now we don't know if Lestat's recollection of events are what actually happened, but it is implied they are much closer to the truth than Louis' recollection, which has been so heavily tainted by emotions, time, his mental health and possibly having his memory modified by Armand. And showing that Louis is still hallucinating Lestat in Dubai shows that what we've been seeing of Dubai may not be as objective as the audience was lead to believe, which is rather intriguing. Yeah, with the implication that Armand has been fucking over Louis mind for years, I'm gonna go on a limb and say the only narrator we could really trust (and even then, to a certain extent) would be Lestat, if he ever gets to share his side of the story. Man, that show is fucking bonkers. And this is probably recency bias talking but I cant think of any other show where the entire cast is that perfect, with no exception and not a single false note since the beginning. This is one of the best write ups I have seen for this season. Thank you for making me think even harder. 👏🏼
Bosch: Finished the series a couple days ago and now watching Bosch: Legacy (the sequel)
Trying: It still feels like quite the fall from the heights of S1-S2. It's like Apple TV saw the success of Ted Lasso and decided all of their comedies needed to be borderline saccharine to work.
Trying: There's something about this season I'm just not loving. Seems to have lost its spark for me.
Trying: I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 but bailed on Season 3.
Ripley: Just finished Ripley and boy, what a ride! I hope Netflix will renew it - I guess its very much up in the air. I've only just started watching it and currently im unsure about the show. It's quite slow and I felt it was style over substance. Is it worth persevering with?
The Boys: They really let Antony Starr go wild in Episode 4.
Slow Horses: Gary Oldman is brilliant as Jackson Lamb. Slow Horses was recently renewed for season 5. Gary Oldman says this is his favorite role he's ever played.
The Boys: Episode 4 was diabolical.
Presumed Innocent: A high level adult drama. It explores the tumultuousness of marriage. Jake G really is at his best playing Rusty, a complex character. The dialogue is amazing. It gives you a peek into inner desires and weaknesses we all have. Ruth Negga is also terrific as his wife.
Wings: My family and I started Wings last night. It’s so fun! Can’t wait to keep watching. Very underrated
Trying: This British comedy about a couple who wants to adopt is sweet but not too sweet. Picked it up when I needed a break from heavy stuff and I was pleasantly surprised. Best comedy on Apple TV imo. Gets better and better with each season. Such a feel good series.
Interview With A Vampire: It is one of the best shows on television and I am consistently blown away by the acting on display. Sam Reid's Lestat is phenomenal but, honestly, so is the entire cast.
Interview With A Vampire: Claudia has been absolutely astounding this season.
Deadloch: Law & Order meets The Office
The Katering Show: The creators of Deadloch and is hilarious
Martin Short: He is guest hosting Kimmel this week and had two Jiminy Glick segments with Bill Hader and Sean Hayes that were insanely funny.
DEATHS GAME: A guy has to live and die 12 lives, after committing suicide. Highly recommended
House of Cards: Rhys Ifans is putting on an acting clinic in HotD S2E2.
Interview with the Vampire: It is dark and gory. Anne Rice wrote the series while drinking heavily after her young daughter died. So grief and tragedy are baked into it. The original novels inspired a lot of "romantic vampire fiction" over the past few decades. The series has a lot of blood and death as the vampire lead explores his new existence as an immortal who needs blood to survive and his relationship to humanity and the destruction he now causes. The show is a "retelling" of the original story where the interviewer is called back as an older man to be told the "true story" of events that took place from when he first became a vampire in the early 1900s to now.
Interview with the Vampire: It's a lot better than it should be. Very enthralling and entertaining. Great job by the showrunners. Could have been many other (worse) things. I just finished season 1. It was a great watch. Very enthralling storytelling. Yes, there is gore and yes it deals with dark subject matter. It reminds me of True Blood but (so far) not as ridiculous or as over the top.
Dark Matter: Just came to say Dark Matter finale was good and the series as a whole is satisfying with a good ending ! So anyone who has not watch, go ahead. It is worth your time. Most of the people in the sub reddit agrees.
The Bad Kids: Brilliant watch and brilliant ending. Chinese series streaming free on iQIYI. Going to miss the adventures of Chaoyang, Pupu, and Yan Liang.
House of the Dragon: Great premiere. Noticed O’Hara from Warrior as the blacksmith and hoping we see more of him. Haven’t read books but assume we will be.
Presumed Innocent: Ruth Negga deserves way better. The DA, Nico, has to be one of the most punchable dudes ever. Not sure how I feel about the show otherwise so far.
Interview with the Vampire: Incredible show. Incredible.
Dark Matter: It has officially hit the fan. Finale is looking to be good.
Blue Lights: Great cop show set in Belfast, Ireland. Love Stevie played by Martin McCann
The Lazarus Project: Really enjoying but also confuses me to no end lol.
House of the Dragon: I found myself not remembering some things after watching the first episode, so I binged. I enjoyed it SO much more than my original watch. I think I still had severe GOT PTSD before.
The Boys: I'm on the pro team for this season, very much enjoy still
Interview With A Vampire: so good. Quality
Dark Matter: After seeing a lot of people here recommending Dark Matter I gave it ago and oh boy, what a show. Absolutely loved it.
Severance: Apple have been putting out some bangers. Severance, Dark Matter and Shrinking are probably my favorite shows in recent years.
Drops of God: Binged this week. Easily in my top 3 Apple TV shows. Kinda sad it seems as underrated as it is.
Acapulco: Keeping up with. Still loving this show and more characters are growing on me. Feels like the writing has improved throughout. Apple must be chucking an absolute fortune at these shows. They've seemingly all got great production quality. What other Apple TV shows are up there for you? I’m presuming Severance is up there
House of the Dragon: Man, between it, it's hard to determine which is the best acted show currently on air...
Interview with the Vampire: Maybe I'd give the edge to it. But the two others are bloody stellar as well in the acting department and have nothing to be jealous about. IWTV has a very compact cast and resembles more of a stage play. By this virtue is a very different dynamic between the actors. Still, the fact that they managed to find relative unknowns that apparently just happen to be the biggest talents in the business, is nothing short of miracle.
The Boys: The Boys has harder task in competing because the cast is so large that it's difficult to avoid having actors that are just "okay".
My So-Called Life: Aired on ABC in 1994. Claire Danes was only fifteen-years-old while filming it. Explores mature subjects. Only lasted one season with nineteen episodes. Jared Leto's character is seen as kind of an asshole.
Freaks and Geeks: Loved by viewers.
Fisk: It's an Australian legal comedy-drama television series.
Colin from Accounts: Watched episode 6 and 7. Took a little turn from being funny to a little serious. Best show out there right now for me. Fully agreed. Can't think of anything I've enjoyed more this year.
Shoresy: Just finished season 3 of Shoresy.  This show has no business being as good as it is.  Phenomenal.
Doctor Who: Also finished episode 8 of this season's Doctor Who.  Felt like a massive mysterious buildup with a ho-hum payoff, but I'm suspicious that the ride's not over yet and we may get a little more closure in the Christmas Special.
Outlander: It’s one of those shows where I’m mourning the characters! I miss them! I love period pieces and apparently am starting to appreciate romance
Dark Matter: after a slow start, it just gets better and better
Trying: the most underrated series on TV. Season 4 is great. Just want more and more episodes
Interview with the Vampire: Just amazing acting, writing, directing and set design all around. Utterly bewildering how it’s not the hottest show on the screen.
House of the Dragon: Just wanted to mention for all the *House of the Dragon* fans, that Max has also begun to drop the second season of the behind-the-scene series, , and it's a separate series entry, not tucked under the *HotD* Extras. The episodes are about 20 minutes long.
Collin from Accounts: Just started watching Collin from Accounts for whatever reason and I'm absolutely loving it. Good comedies are hard to find nowadays and this is one of them. A feel good show to have some good laughs and a simple story. I highly reccomend if you're looking for something like this. I loved this show until episode 7 and then it just ruined the whole thing for me. It takes a strange turn and not in a good way. I barely wanted to watch the last episode after it and I'm definitely not watching season 2 lol so sad after such a strong start cause I was loving it too
Reba: I watched it again because they put it on Netflix and it’s still good
Snowpiercer: Post-apocalyptic scifi. Bunch o' people stuck on a really long train trying to not kill each other, or be killed by the extreme cold outside of the train. It's much bigger and deeper than its limited premise suggests. Stand-out actors are Jennifer Connelly and Daveed Diggs.
3%: Dystopian scifi with battle royale elements. It's voiced in Brazilian Portuguese but the English subtitles are good. The story is a bunch of people from the slums are selected to participate in a competition in order to join a privileged elite. The story and premise evolves significantly with each season. The characters are all super compelling, and the show does a good job of making you feel for everyone no matter their actions or circumstances. Stand-out actors are Bianca Comparato and Vaneza Oliveira, but everyone is a star here. Top tier from beginning to end.
Parasyte The Maxim: Scifi horror. Alien life forms from outer space land on Earth, take over human bodies, and eat people. The story is about the fight for survival, for both humans and the aliens. This is based on a classic manga and has become a classic anime.
Scavengers Reign: I just finished Scavengers Reign and that was quite a journey. I loved it and want something more like it that sort of captures that same captivating disturbing vibe. Would love suggestions on what to watch next, but highly recommend anyone even remotely interested in sci-fi to give Scavengers Reign a try.
Made in Abyss: The only thing I can really think that compares to it is the anime Made in Abyss, both gave me a really similar tone about exploring a foreign land that was not meant for you.
Princess Mononoke: I’ve seen a lot of Ghibli comparisons and whilst I can see it in certain scenes with the style of anime I must say if you haven’t seen the movie Princess Mononoke I highly suggest it.
Dark Matter: nailed the landing
The Acolyte: Many viewers find the scenes cut off too soon, making it hard to fully understand the storyline and leaving dialogue feeling unnatural. The handling of cliffhangers has been criticized for revealing too much and breaking up tension. Some compare the experience of watching the show to dancing the waltz in the wrong time signature, always feeling off. There's a noticeable divide between critics and audiences' opinions on the show.
Dead to Me: This is funnier than it has every right to be. Only note is that in S2, the Michelle actress really needs to go back to acting school because in her very first appearance, her emoting very clearly visibly telegraphed the upcoming relationship plot twist with Judy. As a result I was very not surprised attest of the alls when they finally hooked up. The other supporting characters were great: Nick, Perez, the good-looking fella from Jury Duty; it's just that whoever directed Michelle didn't think to say, "Hey, uh, dial back the male gaze a bit." Also, if you're a fan of Married with Children, there is a very surprising near-reunion to be had in the penultimate episode. 5/5, actually funny women to be found here.
Dark Matter: Dark matter is so much better if you aren't watching it. Apple TV is killing sci-fi right now.
Foundation: Apple TV is killing sci-fi right now. Silo, For all mankind, Foundation, Severance, we are getting spoiled.
The Big Door Prize: I really, really enjoyed it. It turns the town on its ear, asking the townsfolk to reassess their lives. There's wacky characters, funny bits, and a lot of heart. It's definitely worth watching a few episodes to see if it's your vibe. It's a hard show to explain because it's a really weird show. It's one part Ted Lasso where it's about being a better version of yourself, and part Twin Peaks where it's just really strange. The side characters really get to shine in their weirdness.
Perfect Wife: Finished Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini. Very good documentary, I heard of the name, but did not know the particulars of the story, that made it better. I watched, too, after recognizing the face but being unfamiliar with the story. I googled the name of the doc and was immediately hit with a spoiler despite not clicking on any of the links, so I recommend not googling if you want suspense without any idea of what might be going on. Either way, the doc was well done and it’s a fascinating, twisty story.
Babylon Berlin: It’s one of my all time fav series and I’ve been waiting for s4 to be released here for a looong time. I’d love to hear if it’s worth an MHz subscription or not.
The Boys: I just discovered “The Boys.” I have laughed out loud more in the past 4 hours than I have in 4 months. I’m not going to bed until I finish season one (4 more episodes left)!
The Boys: I highly recommend it. Especially if you watched the first 5 seasons of Supernatural (Kripke!!).
The Boys: The show is great. Probably one of my all time favorites. I really don't think there's a single "bad" episode. Every single one is entertaining. Antony Starr and Karl Urban kill it the whole series. You're in for a ride.
The Boys: I recently started watching too. Just got to season 2 and am obsessed. Not sure why I waited so long.
The Boys: The Boys is a wild ride. I'm on Season 4 and it just never stops being good lol
Interview with the Vampire: Each episode the cast are trying to absolutely demolish any other performance on television. Two weeks ago it was Jacob Anderson and Assad Zaman, this week Sam Reid *crushes it* in his long-awaited return. Wow. Wow wow wow. This is the episode we all been waiting for and dreading, and it was as beautiful and soul crushing as expected. What I didn't expect was 1) how much Madeleine would make me sob, and 2) the grotesque horror of a different perspective on one of the pivotal scenes. That was bone-chilling and really drives home how *both* Lestat and Louis, but even more so Louis, are the doom of everyone around them. Yes, this is a love story, but one that brings destruction to themselves and others. And Claudia is their biggest victim. What a masterpiece. Season one was really good, but this season has been absolutely phenomenal. Easily the best show this year so far.
Your Honor: Just finished Your Honor, and what a wasted opportunity. Well acted, well produced, well directed. All the visual trappings of a prestige drama. And absolute *trash* writing. Like CW level bad. Conveniences and nonsensical decision-making by the characters that are just too much to overlook. I watched season 1, and it was painful and stressful to watch lmao. Bad decision after bad decision. And then they just lost the plot in S2. Hahaha I watched the full thing. I won't say I regret it, but it just was not what it could have been. Agree with decision making and just kind of felt a bit all over the place. There were some good concepts but it didn't all come together.
The Boys: Enjoyed the first 4 episodes, although the first 3 were decent with the fourth being the best one so far.
The Bureau: The Bureau, is the best spy series ever made IMO.
Condor: The Bureau or Slow Horses without question. Condor maybe
Berlin Station: I really enjoyed Berlin Station. If you haven't seen it, The Bureau, is the best spy series ever made IMO.
Slow Horses: Have you tried Slow Horses?
Patriot: I know you said you weren't looking for a spy series that's very comedic... But I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend you at least consider giving Patriot a shot.
My Adventures with Superman: Sundays
The Boys: Thursdays
Hannibal: Holy shit that is some quality television. I have binged the whole thing and am finding it something my next t.v. choice will be hard to follow.
American Gods: Next-closest thing (to me) would probably be S1 of American Gods, because Bryan Fuller just pulled in all the same folks to work on it. Except, he also roped in Michael Green to be co-showrunner with him. Just don't go past S1. (That's when Fuller and Green got fired off the show, they took all the *Hannibal* folk with them, and the show went off a cliff).
Mindhunter: If you want an anti-Hannibal (dispassionate and cool where Hannibal is operatic and melodramatic), there's David Fincher's Mindhunter.
Resident Alien: I'm a little late to the party but I just started Resident Alien and its been an absolute delight. Agreed! And it just got renewed for another season!!
Evil: S4e4 was intense, best episode in the whole series.
Loudermilk: On season 2 now. How the hell did I miss this.
Loudermilk: Okay, watched the first episode and I'm hooked. Thanks.
Loudermilk: Loved it, I was 7 years late on it too.
Doctor Who: Was such a great season otherwise. Hoping it's just a fake out for otherwise they botched the ending pretty badly. My first thought with RTD coming back was ‘oh fun but I hope he’s learned to write better finales’ he’s a good show runner but he always kinda botched the finales
The Bear: So glad it's back.
Boat Story: Comedic British procedural
Under the Bridge: Good but dark
Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini
---
The Crown: The Crown is so good! Can't wait for the new season.
Nightmares and Daydreams: I'm a big fan of [Joko Anwar's] movies and this tv show did not disappoint.
Star Wars: Tales of the Empire: 6 episode miniseries. Really enjoyed this one. Essentially it is broken down into two arcs. One about Morgan Elsbeth (who appears in Mandalorian and Ahsoka) and how she goes from Nightsister to working with Thrawn. Was a sad story about how one can turn from oppressed to oppressor. Only complaint is in the first episode an older woman who is in charge of a village tells the people not to worry about getting attacked and to trust her but gives no details. This is after genocide of the Nightsisters nearby. Since she provides no safety or ideas others start training for defense in secret which then backfires when the droids attack only to reveal that the old lady could defend and had a plan the whole time...then the show acts as if she was in the right and everyone else should have trusted her and were wrong to go against her. This was just like in the Last Jedi when Admiral Holdo refused to communicate with her team, everyone goes against her since she gives off that she has no plan, then it is revealed she had a plan all along and the show acts like everyone else was in the wrong for not trusting her.
Star Wars: Tales of the Empire: The second arc follows Barriss Offee and follows up from Clone Wars where she was arrested for murder if I remember correctly? This one is a nice contrast as the arc is kind of opposite showing her redemption arc. However, at the end the show seems to show the Fourth Sister being redeemed which is hard to accept given her genocide of civilians earlier in the show. Would recommend.
Céline Dion: The Céline Dion documentary is really really good.
Fisk: Fisk was wonderful and I found it by accident. Ausie humor resonates with me.
Rake: If you liked Fisk definitely check out Rake
Tour de France: Tour de France on Netflix was fascinating, but the graphic crashes can be hard to watch.
The Gentleman: The Gentleman was a blast, and if you're a Guy Richie fan, was bliss.
Ripley: Finally, I almost quit Ripley after the first episode, but my wife insisted on staying with. She's a smart lady, and it ended up being one of my favorite series ever.
Rosehaven: Since that comment, I've started watching Rosehaven, which is so funny and delightful. Really love the chemistry of the two lead friend characters.
Colin from Accounts: And the season two finale of Colin from Accounts is today, which I'm excited for. It's been my favorite show of this year, handily.
Clipped: I've really been enjoying Clipped. Lawrence Fishburne and Ed O'Neill, as Doc Rivers and Donald Sterling, are both outstanding.
Fantasmas: Dreamy, weird, funny, stream of consciousness skits plus a vague plot. Trailer is so weird, don't know what to make of it.
Young Sheldon: It turns out that Young Sheldon is absolutely nothing like Big Bang Theory. I knew it didn't have a laugh-track, but I imagined it was still full of silly jokes about nerds and geek culture. Turns out, it's basically The Wonder Years, and an ever better version of it than the recently cancelled reboot. The characters feel very real, and they do real things. Kids act like kids. The High Schoolers look like High Schoolers, not actors in their 20s. Most importantly, it does drama and comedy equally well. I tear up from laughing and from the sad/touching moments. The production quality is top notch and a lot of times I forget it's a television show and not a movie. Also, surprisingly, it's a feel-good show where no one is overly mean or cruel, a lot like Schitt's Creek or Ghosts is. Annie Potts is fucking hilarious.
Station Eleven: beautifully done show
Andor: I loved this, episode I can't explain why but from beginning to the end Diego Luna's Character, Andy Serkis showed such range. The Senator's storyline is so good in it's little rebellious undercurrent and her family dynamics. Vel kind of annoys me, But I'm not too hung up on her character. Bix Caleen is a bit of an empty character but again I'm not hung up on her. "What'shername" - She's now in charge of Morlana Six and Ferrix, yeah her, she is so well executed by the actress I hate her, fear her, am inspired by her and kinda feel like she'll be a big reason why the Empire rises. Kyle Soller and his mother ... holy shit relatable. Andor shows what you can do when you are allowed to slow the pace down and develop characters and relationships and situations. When you do that, then the things that happen afterwards have so much more meaning and effect. Compare that to a lot of other SW and Marvel TV shows where it feels like they have a quota for action scenes and so the producer is there snapping their fingers saying "hurry up hurry up" for all the development scenes so that we can get to the action scenes. The effect is to make the action mean only a fraction of what it should because the audience doesn't have the same kind of emotional investment into the whole thing. So with Andor it builds up so much meaning and that makes the action payoff have far more value. Other SW shows fall into the trap of rushing us from scene to scene and then giving us so much action but without a good build up and so the payoff has little effect. Quality vs quantity. A very good prequel to a very good movie (Rogue One). Andor is the only Star Wars show I have liked.
Game of Thrones: That HotD episode was a masterpiece. One of the best of both GoT and HotD combined...
House of the Dragon: That HotD episode was a masterpiece.
Your Honor: "I see “Your Honor” is number 3 on Netflix today, and O truly feel terrible for everyone watching this mess. One of the worst written shows ive ever watched. The plot is asinine"
Moving: Finished Korean drama about people with superpowers. The show starts small, focussing on just a few high school kids. The story slowly broadens to their parents, who they inherited their powers from, and it begins to get really wild.
The Boys: The fourth season is my least favorite so far, but I still like the show a lot.
House of The Dragon: Can not wait for more episodes.
Dark Matter: Can not wait for the season finale.
The Simpsons: I finished season 35 of The Simpsons. I have officially seen all 768 episodes of the show. Even as the show got noticeably worse, I couldn't turn to anything else because The Simpsons had quickly become my comfort show.
Alice in Borderland: Thought reaching the 1st game solution was farfetched since it heavily depended on the guy recalling particular details. Nevertheless excited to see how this goes. Definitely has potential.
Alice in Borderland: Liking this one a lot better. Some interesting characters added.
Presumed Innocent: I started watching it. It's good so far, and I've really been craving some whodunit kinda stuff.
Eastbound and Down: More than halfway through, great so far. Only complaint is that I would have liked to seen more character development in Kenny Powers with how linear the story is.
Vice Principals: Highly recommend if you haven't seen it already. They definitely have that character development that Eastbound and Down lacks. Danny McBride also kills it at both writing and directing.
The Righteous Gemstones: Highly recommend if you haven't seen it already. They definitely have that character development that Eastbound and Down lacks. Danny McBride also kills it at both writing and directing.
private practice: I've watched and rewatched Grey's Anatomy a lot and I'm really liking Private Practice so far as it's related to GA but much more relaxed. It's like a breath of fresh air for me.
Sweet Tooth: First season was good and fresh. S2 onwards started becoming cliché and predictable. I did not like the ending but it does end with S3 with a proper ending.
Sweet Tooth: I found the first season to be great when it came out but there was a big gap between seasons and when it came back it felt different. Haven't seen the third yet but the first season is great and the second season is good.
Sweet Tooth: I thought all three seasons are worth the time investment
Sweet Tooth: Currently on season 3. Been trying to get through it for weeks now. I watch a little then I watch something else. Just want to see it through the end. Writing isn't strong
Dark Matter: Now that Dark Matter season is over I'd like to know which Dark Matter series is better.
Apple TV: The Apple TV show?
Bluey: Try therapy bro
Patriot: Patriot on Amazon Prime
Bear: Glad to see people here are still enjoying the Bear. I'm still re watching season 2 so haven't seen any new episodes but seeing a lot of mixed reviews online.
Shogun: I don't want to get roasted for saying I didn't love it but it was just not my speed. Lots of it was really good, but it was like almost purely drama. I need a bit more of a mix.
The Boys: I've been enjoying season four of it, I guess, but even last season I felt like plot-wise they were spinning their wheels. I do agree with the showrunner than Anthony Starr has been especially great this season. I've been enjoying the acting and the action a lot more than the story this season.
House of the Dragon: I've been loving the return of it. It really scratches the itch for me. How far we have come from the end of the D&D days of Game of Thrones. Rhys Ifans as Otto was hilarious in episode two. Maybe as much or more than the show itself, I've been enjoying the supporting Alt Shift X content about the show and the book lore.
Acapulco: Another wonderful season has come to an end and y'all still sleeping, even after the cross over.
Evil: Micheal Emerson is the best part of the show and he’s barely in it this year
Doctor Who: RTD has not changed how he does big finales, he’s back with all his great and meh parts of his writing. I’ve learned to enjoy the build up and expect the ‘he kills off everyone/goes too far with villain win and then everything is restored like normal with no consequences’ flat endings. My partner enjoyed it but I’m too used to his finales going too far and having to bring things back. Shame as I felt how they defeated the toymaker was big finale enough. Just do something clever vs impossibly epic. Fleabag sister actress doing the same emotions for the apocalypse in same way she did for the bad haircut in fleabag got me laughing when I shouldn’t. Luckily Rubys ending was heartfelt to make it good end. Really moving and perfect for her story
Overall one of the most fun seasons in a long time with some great villains again. The devils chord and dot and bubble were the best.
I miss 13 episodes season though, I feel like we've barely gotten to know the new doctor and Ruby.
the 8 Show: Reminds me of less brutal squid games
Worst of Evil: Korean Crime Drama
Mob Psycho 100: Just finished Mob Psycho 100. Great anime.
Vinland Saga: I love Vinland Saga
Vinland Saga: Vinland Saga is an incredible historical fiction with deep character, love that anime
Death Parade: Contenders are Vinland Saga and Death Parade.
Drifting Dragons: You might like Drifting Dragons. Only 12 episodes.
Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet: You might like Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet too.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These: Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These has a few more seasons but is a very great space opera.
No relevant info.
The Newsroom: Just like Aaron Sorkins The West Wing, the cast have great chemistry.
Doctor Who: Ncuti Gatwa has been a fantastic Doctor. This was a really fun season and looking forward to see where Davies takes it next season.
My Adventures with Superman: Continues to be a great season. Was not expecting their version of Supergirl to be at all like this. It's a real nice twist on the character.
House of the Dragon: Solid Sunday watch, and like everyone else, yes I hate Ser Criston Cole.
Winning Time: Finally finishing this off. As a die hard NBA fan, there's a lot of stuff I like, but also a lot of stuff I just roll my eyes at in terms of it being inaccurate.
The Boys: Shorsey is back
Mayor of Kingstown: Shorsey is back
Dark Matter: Shorsey is back
Presumed Innocent: Shorsey is back
We Are Lady Parts: absolutely wonderful, a breath of fresh air in sitcomland. Love it leaning into the silliness and stylization a bit but still being super sharp with their writing
30 Rock: Finishing up, thinking of what other classic sitcom to tackle next. I like them a bit mean so stuff like Schitt’s creek and Abbott Elementary is too sweet for me. I’ve watched and liked Veep, thick of it, IASIP, Seinfeld, Curb, You’re the worst, Peep Show, the Other Two, now I’m thinking it’s time to tackle some classics from before my time. Maybe Frasier or Married with Children for older sitcoms? Have you watched The Office? Arrested Development? Modern Family and Malcolm in the Middle are fun, too. Have you already watched dramedies like Please Like Me, Fleabag, and Catastrophe? A newer show, Sort Of, may be of interest as well. I recently discovered the Aussie sitcoms, Colin From Accounts, and Fisk - both were quite good.
Polite Society: Have you seen the movie? It's written by the same person and it's fabulous, IMO.
Cheers
Nurse Jackie
Happy Endings
MASH
Dark Matter: I'm like 4 episodes into it and I'm really enjoying it. There are some changes from the book but mostly in good ways, in my opinion.
Bodkin: Not bad! I liked the journey more than the end.
Under the Bridge: Great show! Highly rec. Interesting mystery and immersive story telling.
Dungeon Meshi: Cozy! A fun food adventure.
Boardwalk Empire: it was good but not as good as it could have been. However it made me a Bobby Cannavale fan for life. I usually really like Steve Buscemi but think he was badly miscast in this. Loved season 2 which had a really strong storyline and finish.
Doctor Who: This season started off rocky, got better with each episode leading to some absolutely amazing episodes of television with episodes 4 & 5 in particular, but did not stick the landing of the finale. It wasn't necessarily awful, just an anticlimactic end to what's been the best season of the show since Capaldi's last season 7 years ago.
Doctor Who: Capaldi’s last season was 7 years ago?
Doctor Who: I agree, first episode was awful and almost put me off but I decided to try 2nd and it got better and really started enjoying it
Doctor Who: Thought the first two episodes were kind of dogshit, was going to watch the rest because I heard they got good but if the ending is bad, I don't really see a point? Really disappointing, Ncuti was *amazing* in the specials
House of the Dragon: Has come out of the gates strong, and has not looked back. I appreciate that this show actually provides characters with consequences to their actions.
Dark Matter: This would be my #1 in a world where House of the Dragon didn't come out on fire. The last episode set things up nicely for the finale.
The Boys: Not as strong a story as in years past, it feels a bit wheel-spinning / table-setting thus far, although the last episode was probably the strongest of the season.
The Acolyte: It seems like there is a conscious effort on Disney's part to start these episodes with runtimes of 50 to 60 minutes before ratcheting them way down. Last week's half hour was particularly egregious, weirdly paced and with a badly timed cliffhanger.
Outer Range: We're getting to this point with this show where I'm going to need some flow charts to help keep thing straight. I'm not sure I'm that invested, to be honest. It feels like we've gone two seasons now without any real payoffs.
The Bear: We have a camping trip scheduled for this weekend. If we do not go camping I suspect we may end up binging this instead.
House of the Dragon: Alicent is her father's daughter. When she wanted to confess her sin to him, he didn't want to hear it and knew he wouldn't be able to console her well, and that upset her. But then immediately after when she sees her own son in distress and in need of comfort she does the exact same thing as Otto and avoids it. The twin part was alright. In the book it was laid on too thick. Trying to make some sad poetic shit but I didn't care lol. Didn't care in the show either tbh.
Dark Matter: Dark matter is on top for me.
House of the Dead: HoTD just getting going again but I am looking forward to it.
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Working on IwtV, good so far but I liked season 1 more.
Austin: Aussie show, great so far, promising trailer
Dark Matter: deserves to be on the list of good ongoing shows
Parks and Recreation: started this a few months ago because I was tired of rewatching The Office and I am quite enjoying *most* of the characters, however I'm on S4 and absolutely cannot wrap my head around this Tom/Ann stuff.. wtf. And I thought Angela/Andy was the worst thing I'd seen.
Ripley: At first it seems like a pretentious show and so slow but it is a vibe show and by this episode, I am immerse now and will probably finish the show.
Seinfeld: So I miss Seinfeld, and basically I have been looking for shows that can fill that void as it was a fun show to watch.
Frasier: Frasier did it for me
Schitt's Creek: Schitt’s Creek. We’re on our third rewatch right now.
I'm Sorry: I'm Sorry felt a lot like Seinfeld to me
Curb Your Enthusiasm: Curb your enthusiasm is the obvious one that comes to mind.
Silicon Valley: Silicon Valley
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia scratched that Seinfeld itch for me.
Dark Matter: I loved the dynamic between the crew members on the Raza. The plot twists always kept me on the edge of my seat.
Interview with the Vampire: The casting for Lestat was perfect, and the gothic atmosphere of the show really captured the essence of the book.
Reginald the Vampire: I couldn't get enough of the witty humor in this series. The character development for Reginald was outstanding.
Ted Lasso: 30 minutes into the bear season 3 and this is already the best viewing I’ve had this year, one has to marvel at how brilliantly made this series is.
The Bear: The bear s3 episode 1 was insane. that pacing? i couldn’t even blink an eye! beautiful! so glad it’s back. An amazing artful episode the music and the shots. Just wow
Letterkenny: The surrounding cast just doesn’t stand out like the cast from Letterkenny. I can’t tell the difference between two of main hockey players cause they look and act the same. One doesn’t even speak or interact with the other cast. And the actor who plays Sanguinet looks and sounds like he’s 16 years old.
Blue Lights: Just finished series 2 of Blue Lights: It’s a bit uneven (some of the character choices frustrated me) but overall very well done. I appreciated the dark humor, and it felt balanced. The show neither lionizes police work nor denigrates the job. Dan Gordon, who plays Rab, gives one of the most moving monologues I’ve seen in a spell. I really did miss the character that died in S01 he was so great
Evil: The final season is on right now.
Evil: Is Evil scary? Like I can't tell from the brief description and I don't want to learn too much more because I like going into stuff blind!
Fall of the House of Usher: Was fantastic
Flanagan: Some fans think it’s his weakest show, but it was my first Flanagan show and I loved it.
Highschool of the Dead: more scheming/politics, feels like we’re headed towards some big battles
The Boys: still good so far if you mostly skip through Hughie's/Frenchies subplots this season, in ep 4 they definitely made them more interesting

Six Schizophrenic Brothers: Finished Binging, a 4-part documentary
The Accidental Twins: Finished Binging, a doc-movie on Netflix
Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini: Finished Binging, a 3-part documentary
Station Eleven: ticks similar boxes.
Acapulco: Apple's hidden gem. One of my favorite shows not only on the service but in recent memory. Lighthearted, well-written and lovable characters, nice character arcs, short episodes, and a fantastic soundtrack. The show is charming af, and if it wasn't ~50/50 in spanish/english most of the time I'd say it'd be one of their more popular shows. Cannot recommend it enough.
Dark Matter: A fine show and a fine ending, can't really ask for much more considering all the shows that drop the ball at the end. Nothing incredible for the whole show, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
The Acolyte: This week's episode is one of the best episodes of live action Star Wars ever, yet its IMDb rating is a 3.7 despite being out for just an hour. If you ever needed solid proof of the review bombing, this is it. Last episode I was ready to call it until the last minute of that episode, so gave it one more chance. What a wild episode, I am fully back in. Some fantastic chorography that was not your typical spin to win style lightsaber battles we grew up on. The antagonist, >!while predictable who they are!<, absolutely just upped the stakes. I look forward to where the story progresses from here. This show gets so much uncalled for hate. I really don't get why people expect high art out of Star Wars. It's good for what it is, which is basically a live action comic book aimed at young adults. Very much like The Mandalorian which people go nuts over. Seriously, god damn that was a sick ass half an hour. I thought it was genuinely one of the worst modern hours of SW ever, and that's saying something after some of the Obi-Wan and Boba Fett episodes. That said, I wouldn't be surprised at review bombing. There is a weird gender, LGBT thing cultural war going on in the US that I don't really understand as an Aussie. "one of the best episodes of live action Star Wars ever." I highly doubt that the best episode from Acolyte is going to surpass any episode from Andor. And I hate to be that guy, but going by your comment history you have been defending Acolyte since EP 1. Such a good episode!! One of the best episodes is kind of stretching it for me, if you've watched Andor or even Mandalorian they're much better shows than The Acolyte. I think it's basically a CW Star Wars, but all power to you, although imo the IMDb rating is more than justified hahaha. And why are they review bombing this show in particular?
Dark Matter: Currently watching
The Boys: Currently watching
House of The Dragon: Currently watching
Presumed Innocent: May pick up if the reviews are good
Mr and Mrs Smith: really fun first episode.
Dark Matter: One of the most underrated sci-fi shows out there. It had a good mix of action, mystery, and character development. It's a shame it got cancelled after only three seasons.
The Boys: A fantastic show that offers a different take on the superhero genre. It's dark, gritty, and full of action. The characters are well-developed and the storylines are engaging.
Presumed Innocent: A classic legal thriller movie based on the novel of the same name. It's a gripping story with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.
House of the Dragon: Can't help but compare it to GOT and finding it lacking - there was so much variety of types of characters in GOT, so much more humor and engaging personalities to temper the darkness. HOTD is all so grim and don't feel very invested in the characters, although it is certainly good enough to keep watching. Opening credits of Season 2 are very cool. While Game of Thrones was a story about an entire kingdom, with stories that were connected taking place all across Westeros, House of The Dragon is a palace intrigue show that mainly takes place inside a castle. It's the same characters in the same place each episode. It makes it feel more soap opera like. And it's probably a lot cheaper to film that way.
Game of Thrones: I started rewatching GOT just to understand why I didn't feel as invested in HOTD as I did with GOT. There was such a lived-in feel with GOT and season 1 actors were magic. It's aged so well that even if it were to be released now (the early seasons) it would still be one of the best series. it was a treasure chest of good actors across. I wonder why D&D were not able to recreate the same magic with 3 body problem. I was expecting GOT level of filmmaking instead we got an extremely average fare with actors that didn't resonate.
The Flatshare: Loved the chemistry between the main characters!
The Brother's Son: Just started yesterday and is so far pretty good.
The Bear: I want to savor like a fine wine and haven't started it yet.
Acapulco: May return to based on reviews.
House of Dragons: Will be up next.
House of The Dragon: Watching Episode 2 was very good at moving the show forward. Initially I though Aegon was just another prick like Joffrey but Seeing him crying over his dead son shows the character is more layered than that
The Bear: It is loved by many but can be quite stressful.
Los Espooky's: If you liked Julio Torres in Los Espooky's you should see the show he made. It def reminds me of all the stuff you might think of when you're a bit high on weed or tripping on psychedelics. But actually creating the stories. I think he pulled everything off great so far.
The Acolyte: This show's a bit all over the place. I find it endearing that it fully embraces the inherent ridiculousness of Star Wars. The Korean guy sucks really hard. Like he almost single-handedly manages to sink the whole production. That's power. Also, while I watched the latest episode this realization came upon me: Jedis (or Jedi) are assholes. Entitled, self-righteous assholes. Just saying. I was trying to think of a positive note to end this comment, but I just thought of more of the contrary. Like, the turning points/big reveals you can spot them a mile away.
House of the Dragon: I also watched the first episode of the new season of House of the Dragon, only to realize that the brief recap from the beginning didn't quite fill me in. Like I had forgotten 80% of the first season (horrible cunts with dragons?). Which says something about me, or the show, or both. S1 was often a bit confusing with the time jumps, half the characters with the same or nearly the same name, and so many of them with the distinct white hair making them harder to tell apart on top of the confusing name thing. I suspect it's a lot easier to track things on a rewatch though. Looks better this season so far.
House of the Dragon: It's very good as its own show. It's no early GoT, but still enjoyable. Season 1 had an absolute standout performance by one of the main characters.
House of the Dragon: It has a very different vibe to GoT but the writing, production value and acting are all in the A+-Tier of TV. Worth giving a shot.
House of the Dragon: I watched a few episodes of the first season and thought it was really dull, like GoT but with all the fun stripped out. Maybe it’s got better.
House of the Dragon: Its OK
Dark Matter: was so solid! esp episode 3 to 8. I don’t know why the ending didn’t land for me. It was good tbh, but maybe I was expecting more? Nonetheless fabulous show!
Shrinking: It feels way too sitcom-ey: full of tropes, dialogue that’s way too polished and quippy, and conflict springing out of basic misunderstandings. The main character is an AWFUL psychologist which the show endorses by only half heartedly condemning him.
Dark Matter: Some excellent acting and directing has elevated this series and it helps ignore the plot holes and fuzzy physics.
Presumed Innocent: Fairly gripping with very good actors.
Sugar: It was just not as gripping or engaging.
Defending the Guilty: fun British 6 episode show that I guess went way under the radar, wish it could've gotten renewed but oh well
Defending the Guilty: As a sucker for legal shows (serious or not-so-serious) I too wish this had been renewed.
House of Dragon: week to week
The Boys: week to week
The Bear: coming back on Thursday
Castle Rock: Season 2 is really interesting. Lizzy Kaplan does an amazing job playing a young Annie Wilkes. While I did find the ending a bit contrived, it's an interesting (if bizarre) prequel to Misery.
Smiling Friends: SF continues to surprise me with how just how easy they make blending 3D characters or claymation with 2D designs, on top of the wildly absurd stuff coupled with something dry out of Home Movies.
Clipped: While it feels like something that should have happened 8 or so years ago, FX's limited series about the Donald Sterling scandal feels both hammed up and somewhat undercooked at the same time. Despite this great performances by Ed O'Neil and Laurence Fishburne keep things worth watching.
Dark Matter: Just watched the finale and it’s kinda amusing. Overall, it’s a good show but I don’t think it’s impressing anyone. The ending teases something but it’s not that interesting to me and I don’t think there’s anything significant that would justify season 2. I’m ok if the show is not renewed. If it gets renewed, I rather they make a new character barely related to the current ones and a new storyline with a completely different theme that’s not all just family and love…pff so corny. I think it is one of my top 3 shows of 2024. It is overall very good. I do agree if there is a S2, they need to follow the interesting support characters and not the Jason family though I will miss Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Connelly (both were great). The ending teases something but it’s not that interesting to me.
Presumed Innocent: Typical whoddunnit, you watch for the actors more than the plot.
Doctor Who: There are stand out episodes (Maestro/Jynx Monsoon & Bridgerton). The overarching arc is 50/50. The quality is so much improved, it's that Disney money working for what used to be a campy production.
House of the Dragon: Slow build up, just fine. Interesting end. Emma D'Arcy is great. And Rhae's costume / makeup is strikingly so beautiful and haunting. Love the new opening credits, altho reminds me of The Last of Us.
The Boys: Only finished half, not vibing with it. Maybe I'm just sleep deprived when we watched it. It has the usual action / shocking stuff.
No relevant info.
Acolyte: They killed off more characters than I expected in this episode. There were few unknown red shirts I knew would die but few established cast I thought had plot armour or Disney merch armour who died. The fight was good, choreography was good. So far definitely not up to andor quality but miles better than boba fett and mandolorian (that was fun but kinda lost itself) better then the prequels and much better than the last two sequel films. It’s interesting for a show that’s killing off so many characters that it keeps a flashy look. I wonder if this put some people off, it kinda has the ‘fun’ Star Wars look for what is a ‘you’re going to watch a lot of Jedi get murdered’ show
Acolyte: Acolyte doesn't deserve the vitriol, episode 3 was dull but the others have been entertaining and at a good pace.
Fargo: Fargo - not as good as 1 and 2 imo but still high quality
The Fable: The Fable anime is superb, the various interweaving threads of the story is written so well and all the characters get you invested in some way with them.
House of the Dragon: House of the Dragon, strong opening episode shits escalating again already.
The Boys: The Boys is the Boys the satire is now unapologetic and nails the current media climate and Homelander always has you on the edge of your seat. The new noir is hilarious as is the deeps arc.
The Boys: I don't think it's the worst season or that the writing has taken a dip, but it is getting harder and harder to watch. It's getting very depressing and a little too real.
Miss Scarlet and the Duke: The main characters' budding romance is really cute, and they have a lot of chemistry.
House of the Dragon: top tier show for costumes, sets, acting, lot of great character moments this week.
The Bear: fantastic start with carmy's ep and we're back to all the insane kitchen stress. there's 1 cameo that's too distracting so I didn't like ******** here.
The Americans: Just got to S6 of The Americans and it's phenomenal. After GoT shit the bed, I didn't want to take chances with any terrible endings. Switched to The Americans and have loved it all the way. Excited for the ending as the ratings hold up and even get better throughout.
Mad Men: Next up on the long series watch is probably Mad Men, but open to suggestions!
Nothing to output.
Dark Matter: The series overall was quite good but I found the finale to be only satisfactory rather than good. Felt like they might have needed another episode as everything felt too rushed compared to the pace of the rest of the show.
The Boys: While it does feel like it's just treading the same ground as earlier seasons, the show is entertaining enough to still enjoy.
The Boys: I watched the first episode of the boys and honestly I lost interest in the show for the moment.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine: So I'm binging all the seasons of Brooklyn 99 and I'm having a good time. Very funny.
The Boys: Need more sad and scared Claudia Doumit from The Boys injected into my veins.
My Lady Jane: I binge-watched it and was not prepared for the fantasy element when I just wanted romance lol but it’s a fun show to watch if you have nothing on your list.
The Boys: I've enjoyed all seasons of The Boys as well as Gen V, but the latest episode was feel bad TV and wasn't much fun to watch besides Starr's acting. I realized that this season I don't finish the episodes with much pleasure, more like apathy, at least until this latest ep. Next season will be the last anyway, might as well finish it. Yeah, pretty disappointing episode and season so far. There are a few story threads that have me interested so maybe the season can end kind of strong. I'll be watching every episode of show left regardless since I'm this far in already.

The Bear: I just watched the first episode of season 3. I was transfixed. I finished the episode, went for a workout, listened to the NIN song that played during the entire episode on loop, came back, and rewatched this episode.
House of the Dragon: Not really feeling it. I just don't care enough about these characters. I do like Rhys Ifans. He's maybe the only actor good enough to elevate the boring script. At least until Freddie Fox makes an appearance. I'm more so watching now in the hopes that it will improve, and for the occasional moments of spectacle which are sure to come.
The Bear: The music in the background as you’re watching the anxiety build up.
Oz: Well if you ever want the opposite of what you asked, I strongly recommend Oz.

The Bear: Did I miss a scene where Carmy stole the clock from his group therapy in the opening of E3? Because the literal exact same clock was in The Bear's kitchen starting in E9, or at least that's when I started to really notice it. Smart of the production crew to save money by reusing props I guess. Found it kind of odd towards the beginning of that episode where Sydney's dad is wearing his work shirt with his name on it while chilling at home offering his daughter a coffee and offers for her to "live here forever". Literally no one does this at all in the real world. Normal people tend to wait until right before they clock in before shrugging themselves into their work shirt, and normal people don't let their adult children keep living with them. But I guess the prop department REALLY NEEDED to let me know that Emmanuel's not only a hard-working blue collar man, but also sensitive too! Ostensibly idealistic and heart-warming, but ultimately damaging when impressionable viewers tries to apply this takeaway to the real world and have reality shit down their fucking necks. edit: Just saw the S3E4 synopsis saying that she's getting her own apartment so I guess my outlook was correct as always. God, it's so tiring being right all the time!
The Handmaid's Tale: Also, I remember the thread that someone linked me to which was my first time visiting reddit which was about The Handmaid's Tale and its extensive number of close-ups on monologuing faces. Reason why that sprung to mind was because I feel like the same crew is doing this show, too. Awful lot of facial close-ups, and it makes me feel like they're working around the fact that the actors are either not in the same room together or having to do a lot of reshoots.
Hilda: I really enjoyed the animation style of this show. It's so unique and charming.
The Bear: Just finished Season 3. When the camera cuts to what he’s looking at. Oh god.
