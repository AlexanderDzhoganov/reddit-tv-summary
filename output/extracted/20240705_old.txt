Interview With The Vampire: Great sophomore season, continually impressed with the cast and acting. Faithful (mostly) to the source material as well.
Bosch: Somehow they’ve turned a police drama into something special, not quite “The Wire” or “The Shield”, but it’s up there for us. Just finished the shield. It entirely deserves it's accolades. If Bosch comes close i'd be keen to give it another shot. I remember the first season feeling pretty hokey when I started it many years ago.
School Spirits: A Paramount + original that's also airing on Netflix. The first fifteen minutes are pretty stupid, but once that passes it turns into a charming "ghost tries to solve her own murder" YA story. Fun characters, interesting twists.
The Boys: I'm finding this season of The Boys pretty uninteresting, every episode feels so bloated. It's a shame because I used to really like it. Now I'm just holding out hope the final season will recapture the magic. It's actually bad. Homelanders facial twitches aren't enough to pad a show that is stalling for applause and not doing nearly enough to get it. I stopped watching the new season after a couple of episodes. It feels mediocre. I feel like they should have ended it last season itself.
The Queen's Gambit: I finally watched this show. The costumes, sets, music were on point. Anya was electric as Beth and the final confrontation with Borgov was my favorite scene from the show. Such a feel good show that somehow made me invested in Chess.
Dark Matter: It's like a dream come true for me. A show that combines the concept of a parallel universe with a mature tone and has a realistic vibe is something I've wanted to see for many years. Joel Edgerton who plays some of the main characters managed to create a clear different feel for each of them without using excessive showmanship/accessories to highlight the differences. It's a must try for fans of quality sci-fi. Also highly character driven and goes much further with the concept than I expected them to in a single season.
Presumed Innocent: I finally started and watched the first 4 episodes in one sitting. Pretty damn good!
The Sopranos: there is nothing like a big plate of lasagne and a few episodes of The Sopranos
Buffy: Currently catching up on Buffy. Buffy is so great. Enjoy!
The Shield: Currently catching up on The Shield.
Venture Bros: Currently catching up on Venture Bros. Go Team Venture! \\/
The Other Two: I have finally started watching The Other Two on Max and there hasn’t been a show that has literally made me laugh out loud in a while the way this show does repeatedly. It's a cultural successor to 30 Rock, and it deserved as many seasons! I loved season 3 especially, so look forward to the show getting even better! Just started it and loving it, reminds me of Hacks. Thanks for the rec!
Babylon Berlin: 2 epi releases per week and I just want to binge. Such a well done show.  
The Lazarus Project: Im confused. Babylon Berlin s4 released in 2022?  
House of the Dragon: I’m so stoked for s4 of Babylon Berlin. It feels like I’ve been waiting forever so I can wait a little longer until all the episodes are released and then binge the hell out of them. Glad to hear the quality hasn’t dipped…that’s always a concern.
Freaks and Geeks: Martin Starr is consistently great, check out Party Down!
Party Down: Martin Starr is consistently great, he's the best character in both Freaks and Geeks and Party Down!
Interview with the Vampire: I watched interview with the vampire as more of a background show. It seemed slow at times so didn’t always grab my attention. After reading the good reviews on season 2, I decided to give it a go and wow! Rarely do I feel shows get better with season 2, but this one definitely did. Two episodes in and I went back to give season 1 a re-watch and this time it had my full attention. Really loving this showing and it’s fast becoming a favorite that I feel will be on rotation when there’s nothing new to watch. The show has such a great rewatch value, they really are utilizing little details sprinkled around the episodes to pay it off by the time the finale rolls around. Plus a lot of plot clues are hidden or hinted at in the dialogue, so it really rewards you paying attention.
House of the Dragon: Watching season 2 weekly and loving it. Sunday’s episode looks to be a big one.
Hacks: Binging season 3. I forgot how much I missed this show. Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder’s chemistry is just so good.
Douglas is Cancelled: I was a little worried this might be one of those anti-consequence messaging shows so was wary going into it but decided to give it a chance after the trailer made it seem intriguing. I’m glad I took a chance on this one as it was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the better ITV offerings I’ve seen in years. The show nailed the balance between comedy and drama and was very satisfying despite hinting at some dark subject matter. The main cast was very good particularly the two leads Karen Gillan and Hugh Bonneville. I also liked the pacing of the show and how the plot developed in an unexpected but enthralling way. It was only 4 episodes long but that seemed the perfect amount of time needed to tell this story.
Sugar: This was OK. A modern day LA detective noir with a weird scifi twist. Collin Farrell had a good outing as John Sugar but the plot was never all that exciting. If they make more I’ll watch more but I did not love it as much as a lot of others have. Reminds me of Under the Silver Lake with its artsy style!
Blue Ridge: Meh…this was a passable old school weekly crime show. Reminded me a bit of a modern day Walker Texas Ranger but with a bit more of a rural setting. Watchable but definitely a tad forgettable.
Under the Bridge: I really enjoyed this true crime drama. It told the story tale of the murder of high schooler Reena Virk and the following investigation to catch the killers. It was a compelling tale and all the more horrifying for being based on true events. Both Riley Keogh and Lily Gladstone were as good as expected from such great actresses but I think the young cast also deserve a lot of credit as they were fantastic in their roles. A real mix of naive, vulnerable, cruel, and charismatic in equal turns. Excellent crime show.
Clipped: This was another excellent drama based on true events. This time chronicling the downfall of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after a racist video came to light. It was a fascinating story that I was completely unaware of being neither American or a basketball fan. The show mixed drama and comedy well and had fantastic performances from most of the cast. Crazy story but a real fun TV show!
The Veil: I enjoyed this spy drama. It was not quite on the level of The Old Man but it was watchable and pretty good despite some improbable moments. The leads, Elisabeth Moss and Yumna Marwan, were excellent in their roles while I felt like Josh Charles had some scene stealing moments as an obnoxious CIA agent with a penchant for rubbing folks the wrong way. It was not a perfect show and I was not super keen on the ending but on the whole this limited series still gets a big thumbs up from me.
Loki: Currently, I'm watching "Loki" and finding it captivating with its blend of intrigue, humor, and unexpected twists.
Succession: For recommendations, I'd suggest checking out "Succession" if you enjoy intense family drama with a touch of dark humor.
Ted Lasso: For recommendations, I'd suggest checking out "Ted Lasso" for a heartwarming and funny series about an American football coach in the UK.
Firefly: Farscape, one of the best “crew becomes a found family” sci fi shows. A few others: Fallout, Severance, Orphan Black, Dead Like Me, Reservation Dogs (not sci fi, but a good found family vibe). Okay here me out: House. It gets very formulaic after a while and they cycle in and out various side characters but they key 3-4 are great and very distinct.
Cowboy Bebop: Since you mentioned Cowboy Bebop and Dark Matter, I assume you mean the 2015-17 Syfy space-opera (which took inspiration from Cowboy Bebop).
Dark Matter: Since you mentioned Cowboy Bebop and Dark Matter, I assume you mean the 2015-17 Syfy space-opera (which took inspiration from Cowboy Bebop).
American Horror Story: I've been rewatching American Horror Story.
Superstore: I've been rewatching Superstore.
Glee: I just finished Glee.
Gossip Girl: I am now starting Gossip Girl.
That 90s Show: I know it's 100% nostalgia but I get a good chuckle from it from time to time.
That 90s Show: I could watch a full series just about Red and Kitty.
Station Eleven: This show is exceptionally good at combining music, cinematography, and editing to get you intense chills/feels.
Trying: This has always been such a lovely show and S4 is no different. I was skeptical of the show continuing due to S3 wrapping everything up with a nice little bow but the time jump does wonders to breathe new life into the show and makes it feel somewhat like a soft reboot. There's new stories to tell now for subsequent seasons and if S4 is anything to go by (especially with that juicy ending) then the show isn't going to run out of steam any time soon.
Real Bros of Simi Valley: Originally a Facebook TV series, it moved to YouTube, and it's absolutely hilarious. It's like Trailer Park Boys moved to California. Highly recommend it for a good laugh!
Las Mesías: I'm watching a Spanish miniseries called Las Mesías (*The Messiah*) do NOT get confused by the Netflix TV show, not that one. So far I'm around 4 episodes in and the series is incredible, I was very much hooked from the beginning, there's so much intrigue and things going on in each episode that they go by slowly yet at the same time I don't want it to end. The art direction, cinematography and use of the soundtrack is superb, lots of really powerful moments. It's hard to give a description without spoiling anything but it deals with things such as childhood trauma, religious fanaticism, conspiracy theories, cults, etc. I would say the closest thing I can compare it to is *The Leftovers* but it's still very much unique.
Star Trek Prodigy: Netflix just dropped season two and its even better than season one. The first handful of episodes from S1 feel like Star Wars, which was absolutely intentional to hook young viewers. After that it got better and better and more Trek in all the best ways. Season two has a different feel in that there are far less standalone episodes but it is just as good if not better than season one. Its marketed to kids but its for everyone. Yes, there are things that are obviously targeted at children but if you're a fan of Trek, even if you're a scifi fan who has never watched Trek, you will enjoy this show. Long time Trek viewers will be rewarded with tie-ins to Next Generation, Voyager, Picard, Trek Shorts, and there's even a funny mention of the Cerritos. I don't think any of that is a spoiler, its an incentive. Agreed. I liked the show from the start, but can see how it may take some time for it to click with others. But it's gotten progressively better as it's gone on. This season was on another level for me. I really hope it does well enough to get a season 3 because it deserves it. Plus the set-up for a potential new story is very interesting. But even if it doesn't, it's a hell of a journey with a very satisfying ending in its own way.
Lost Girl: Just finished  
Eureka: now I'm bingeing
Young Royals: We're watching Young Royals and 13 Reasons Why. Not sure why at 60+ I'm enjoying teen dramas so much, but a lot of them are very well written these days. Young people are having to deal with a lot more that we did at that age. Try out Skins, be careful!
13 Reasons Why: I haven’t seen young royals yet so maybe I’ll give that a go but with 13 reasons why the seasons start becoming a parody of themselves. Season 1 was good and 2 was decent, I gave up soon after that.
Cruel Summer: If you liked that you may also like cruel summer which is on Hulu. Season 1 was good and season 2 was so-so.
Outer Banks: Another good one I enjoyed was outer banks. It’s centered around a treasure hunt and I found it pretty engaging. I believe there are 3 or maybe 4 seasons in total.
Your Honor: Not sure if I like it very much, not worth the time.
The Boys: The writing in this season is sub-par and I'm not saying it because of politics. However I like the characters and the world so much that I started again at Season 1...
Suicide Squad: isekai  
My Adventures with Superman: No information available
Sandman: I know I’m late to the party, but I finally finished watching Sandman last night, and wow, what an incredible show! The production quality is amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy. I can’t wait for season 2! I wanted to read the book, but after hearing the SA allegations against Neil Gaiman, I don’t know.
House of the Dragon: great
The Boys: spinning its wheel, not good
The Acolyte: 1 cool lightsaber fight, now its dragging again
We Are Lady Parts: season two was not as enjoyable as season one. I much preferred Amina as the focus, and season one was funnier and lighter.
Mozart in the Jungle: Recently found and binged Mozart in the Jungle on amazon, I was really hooked into it and went through all 4 seasons and was disappointed that amazon cancelled it :(
Mozart in the Jungle: Man that looks awesome. Thanks for the recommendation.
The Boys: Scenes with The Seven (and Nuemann) and Butcher are still interesting. Get the rest of "The Boys" ( i.e. Hughie, MM, Frenchie. Kimiko and Starlight ) involved however and the show becomes boring as hell quick. They're dumb and never get anything done. Prime example is the episode with Homelander being terrifying inside that lab and it's cut with scenes of whatever Hughie and Kimiko were doing. I think it's for the best they're ending the show next season and continue on a more supe-focused Gen V.
The Boys: I had to laugh so hard at the big 'reveal'.. i hope they didn't expect it to be shocking or anything. I usually NEVER second guess these things or have plot theories while watching a show, and even I thought in the first scene that they showed the dude "oh, he's not real". For once at least this episode they had something resembling a plot or action, where we follow a group of people performing a singular task (break in) through several scenes, as opposed to the usual boys episode of thirty scenes of different people standing in different rooms talking about their motivations.
Big Little Lies: The show was so boring, nothing kept me interested. The book was good though, in my opinion.
Sharp Objects: It was so good. It was a build up that really made me interested.
Heroes: Binge watching, currently on season 3.
A Good Girl's Guide to Murder: It was okay, liked the book more.
The Bear: Season 3 was okay, not as good as the first 2 seasons. Season was just a building up season.
Dark Matter: Just ended last week, great watch.
The Boys: Brilliant as usual.
Hotd: Enjoying.
The Acolyte: New episode was Meh, show is pretty mid.
Boys on the Boat: loved
Homeland: +1 for Homeland. Haven’t seen anyone recommend this in years!
Mrs. AX: Ah summer - when the tragically-full DVR finally goes below 50% because we're catching up on everything Mrs. AX recorded during the year.
Elspeth: Quirky, yet satisfying. The first season ended much as I expected. Kinda reminds me of Columbo.
So Help Me Todd: She loves it, I tolerate it. Too many MacGuffins for my taste - you can see the plot twists coming from center field.
The Jinx: Holy crap that was insane! Investigative journalism at its finest.
Star Trek Discovery: Yeah, late to the party, but worth the wait. I don't know what my friends are complaining about, honestly. It's well-written, well-directed, and so much eye candy.
The Traitors: Seriously, Goddess bless Alan Cumming. And his tailor. And his accent. I can't imagine this show being as good with anyone else at the helm. The twist in the final episode was extremely satisfying.
The 1%: Turns out I'm actually pretty freakin' smart, and have been persuaded to apply for an upcoming season. Since I adore Patton, it's a win/win.
The Quiz with Balls: Stupid fun. Worth a watch.
Silo: I watched five or six episodes of Silo, I really can’t understand why this show was so recommended, does it get better? It really feels drawn out. You’ll be wanting for more when you see what the last episode has in store. Silo has almost 0 soul. It isn't worth the investment imo. It's just a pretty slow show. I was also slightly annoyed by it, since you are mostly waiting for the characters to catch up to the viewer. Or they do things like try a single thing to solve something unknown, it doesn't work, and then they never bother with it again. Considering it's based on a finished book series I will stick with it, no danger of it going off the rails, and I like the setting.
The Walking Dead: I cut my losses after season nine. I could rewatch season one but that’s about it.
Catching Lightning: Showtime docuseries about the 2006 Securitas robbery in Kent, England partially orchestrated by former UFC hopeful "Lightning" Lee Murray.
30 for 30: The Story of Faze Clan: A 30 for 30 documentary about Faze Clan, discussing their massive $1 billion valuation and controversies with the crypto pump and dump scheme and running a Counter-Strike gambling service.
The Bear: Do you feel S4 will be the last season? Honestly I almost feel like the show was initially supposed to be 3 seasons and it got stretched with this filler season. I feel like season 3 is a clear rampup to season 4 and therefore doesn't work as well as a standalone. I think they won't overstay their welcome, so 4 may well be the final season. Especially with Ayo and Jeremy's stars blowing up. I think they will for sure push for a 4th. If for nothing else just to prove that the show still has some integrity. I couldn't even get through this season and I was a die hard fan of the first two.
Sharp Objects: My initial thought was that it was going to be some kind of female centric True Detective but it's definitely it's own thing. Some incredibly subtle camera work and transitions in it that lend it it's own feel. Amy Adams is very impressive as always but here there is something that feels more personal. If I had to level a criticism it would be more to do with my bias against overuse of flashback imagery. I'm only halfway through the first season so my hope is they clean that up a bit. It's the opposite of feelgood so anyone looking for an easy watch should stay away.
Furia: Half watched a Norwegian-German drama show about infiltrating and defeating right wing extremists. The show is a weird mix of things, feels like something you've watched before, or reminds you of something else. The handling of themes and subjects of right wing extremism is extremely in your face and on the nose. The villain and mastermind behind it all spews out very on the nose dialogue. The show has weird pacing and focus, passable acting, and by the numbers storytelling for most of the time, making it a less than enjoyable viewing experience.
Between: It's Canadian. It's about this walled community/city wherein they are protected from the plague outside. They start to notice their fishes inside their city starting to die, so they start investigating what's causing this and they wonder maybe this plague has entered their city.
America's Sweethearts: I am very into behind the scenes shows specifically about sports as I have the hand-eye coordination and spatial reasoning of an undifferentiated clump of cells, so I find them fascinating. I actually have Deep ThoughtsTM about the reaction online to the older women who are running the show: the two coaches and managers and Charlotte Jones. I recently saw a TT where someone was excoriating them as horrible, awful, mean, terrible, but the only concrete example was the insistence that they be called "ma'am." I dunno, I think this is sexism and internalized misogyny with a sprinkle of ageism, frankly. I didn't see these older women cursing, insulting, or otherwise treating these younger women with anything but stern respect and having very high standards. I strongly (strongly) suspect if these were men, we would have nothing to say except that they were "geniuses" like Steve Jobs types. They are exacting and focused Type A people, so what. One of them (Kelly I believe) is directly responsible for growing the DCC into a multi million dollar org. I don't want to hear what a "bitch" she is. She's a hard nosed business-person, sure. But this take really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure it's up to Charlotte Jones per se to decide on the DCC salaries (the other area the TT-er was going on about) and it is a part time entertaiment job that 1000s of women want. I can imagine it's very difficult to peg that market rate for that job. Also I really pity Victoria--my heart breaks for her. She's not the same kind of beautiful as the other women and clearly isn't the same personality type (ultra extroverted, bubbly, conventional/normal). Victoria the call is coming from in the house with that Grey Gardens set up you have with Mother Dearest. Blink twice girl!
Tell them you love me: Holy CRAP. Where to start. I will say this: the documentary (like all of them) has a tendency to let their subjects go unchallenged. One example is when John the older brother gets "freaked out" by the main lady/perp saying that she would "sign in blood" to be with DMan--hello John, listen to the *whole message*. It says she would sign a contract that she would **get divorced** to be with "Dman". (which...still doesn't paint her in a great light, admittedly). This kind of basic mishearing and misunderstanding reduces the credibility of the subjects, and they 100% have a case! She assaulted him! She r_ped him! It's sickening. But what's most confusing to me is how a woman her age and with her intelligence could find a man who is so *clearly* mentally compromised and like half her height and weight attractive *physically*!!! I used to work with special needs college students, I was called the "handicapped whisperer" (these were less sensitive times) because I had a knack for understanding people with severe speech and cognition struggles. I had a student ask me what I wanted and promise to get my anything I wanted--his name was Rodney and he'd been shot in the head in a gang alteraction and had permanent brain damage. I told him "you can get me the VHS tape of *L.A. Story* if you want, but nothing more expensive than that" because he had the **mind of a child**!! (He did get it and I was very touched). He was technically an adult but there was like...ZERO chance I would let him think I was interested, etc.
Vanderpump Rules: last episode of Season 11, reunion. I mean, LaLa has a point, but she is so aggressive and unable to articulate it and so self-serving that it gets lost in the bickering. I feel for Jo--Jesus CHRIST woman have some dignity. Yes, it's startling just how beautiful Tom Schwartz was at one point--he probably could have been a celebrity if he had laid off the drugs and drinking, but GIRL. It's L.A. There's 10 million of them out there. And he's nowhere near the looks he had!
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny: The latest Indiana Jones adventure is out, and people are loving it for its nostalgic feel and thrilling action scenes.
Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan’s new biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb is a must-watch. It's gripping and full of amazing performances.
Barbie: This one's fun and colorful, blending humor and heart. It's a fresh and entertaining take on the classic doll’s story.
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: Tom Cruise is back with another Mission: Impossible film. Expect incredible stunts and intense action.
Secret Invasion: Marvel's newest series focuses on the Skrull invasion of Earth, with Samuel L. Jackson returning as Nick Fury.
The Bear: This show about a young chef running a family restaurant is getting rave reviews for its storytelling and performances.
Stranger Things: The latest season of this beloved sci-fi series is here, promising more thrills and mysteries.
The Witcher: Henry Cavill is back as Geralt of Rivia in the newest season of this fantasy series, full of monster-hunting and political intrigue.
Love In A Cold Climate: if you have watched the show please upvote me!
