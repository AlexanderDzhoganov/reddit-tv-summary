But it's something I can sit and shut off my brain and enjoy the masculine rage. Boom boom yeah, go beat them bad guys. Boom boom boom.\n\n**Fargo** is going great, enjoying this season so far. However, I'm keenly waiting for some action and I feel like every episode is building up to an eventual outburst. Glad I'll be anticipating for that drum soundtrack \u2014 that's when you know it's gonna get real. >!Despised that awful man-child of a husband, I want the douche gone or get his arse whipped to dark age!<\n\nWaiting for **Slow Horses** to conclude so I can binge watch the whole season.\n\nAbout to start **Scott pilgrim vs the world** and **Carol and the end of the world**.\n\n**Blue Eye Samurai**, wow, just wow. Love it.\n\nWish there were more animation shows like **Close Enough**, **Tuca and Bertie**, and **Bojack Horseman** for adults. \n\n**Scavengers Reign** was phenomenal. I was attached to the subtle attentions to details and line-works. The artwork, character design, environments, and props were amazing. Every creative show give it a watch just for the art.\n\n**Odd taxi** was fun, not like other anime. You got characters partaking in normal conversations and not \"animized\" with the child-like monologues often found in animes.\n\n**Vinland Saga** is interesting, will give it a few more episodes to decide if it's worth commiting to watching the whole series.",

It absolutely knocks it out of the park for Thanksgiving but very few of the Christmas episodes stand out to me (last year\u2019s being an exception - *The Plight Before Christmas* is not just a good holiday episode but one of the best episodes of the show, period). This year\u2019s outing wasn\u2019t as emotionally resonant, but not bad by any means. I got a few solid laughs, especially where a certain painting was concerned, but overall just okay.\n\n**Invincible:** only have gotten through 2 episodes of this but very excited to see where this one goes. What a stacked cast - Steven Yeun, JK Simmons, Sandra Oh, Gillian Jacobs, Jason Mantazoukas, Zachary Quinto, Walton Goggins\u2026 very ready to binge some more of this over the weekend.",

Way too much emphasis on the luncheons and the attire and parties for me.. i would rather see the the things that made them all rich.. the railroads and mining and factories and all that stuff. No real evil or bad guys..even though all of the elites are technically bad guys.  \n\n**Lawmen Bass Reeves**  I love westerns.. this was ok.  Again i think they played it too safe..not a whole lot of gunfights and the bad guys werent that bad.  Barry Pepper did everything he could with his role and what he was given.. Dennis Quaid's character was pretty weak imho.  Donald Sutherland is almost 90... he did the best he could i think.   Shea Whigham nailed his role as well..he always does.  Bass Reeves- i didnt see anything really special about his gunfighting or his grit.  Would have been much better if they showcased his skills instead of his struggles i think. \n\n**Beacon 23**  I really like sci-fi but this was pretty lame.

Like, it was entertaining I guess but some parts of the internet have absolutely lost their minds over this show. It has a massive fandom after 1 episode, and also there is a backlash against that fandom as well. \n\nI do like that Harlan Ellison's *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream* is an inspiration here. I can see it though I imagine that most of the millions of people who watched are too young to know about that short story. \n\nThe intrigue and horror of the situation is a little compelling and the characters are interesting enough that I could continue watching whenever more is made. One criticism you'll see and that I agree with is it is too hyper, and is trying to court low attention span viewers. I'd agree with that and would've been happy for the same story in a bit more focused format. It might be bad for us an audience to embrace this sort of content.",

I guess this show is about finding meaning, in others, in work, in whatever. It's not easy to pinpoint one particular thesis behind it (mind you, I still have a few episodes to go).\n\nSo, **What if,** season 2. I think the most solid episodes have been \"What If... Iron Man Crashed into the Grandmaster?\" and \"What If... Kahhori Reshaped the World?\". Very rewatchable. The Kahhori episode was especially memorable, and quite frankly, it felt to me like an instant classic. The only but, maybe, would go to the main antagonists, the Spanish captain and the Queen of Spain. Which came across as just very one dimensional baddies for kids. I mean, iniquity comes with a calm demeanor and a smile in the face, especially from powerful people.  But yeah, dramatic purposes, ok.\n\nI've also been watching old clips from **Conan** from 10, 20 or even 30 years ago. I think what stands the test of time the best is the skits, full of silliness and surrealism. Then some stuff got a bit old or a bit cringy, like Conan doing his pervy growling whenever an attractive female guest was interviewed. It's interesting watching his evolution through the years, from the mid-90's where he looks quite intimidated by the whole thing, to the early 2000's, peak Conan, to a later more grounded one. Love Brian Stack, love Andy, love Schlansky. Love Smigel and Triumph (some of that stuff wouldn't air these days). Love Max and Conan stare contests.\n\nEdit: love In the Year 2000...",

Although I finished this series (which requires some research to figure out which frigging variations you are supposed to watch) I kind of wish I hadn't. The SF elements are a loose cover for a very weird mix of borderline-illegal adolescent sex stuff, Freudian psychoanalysis, high-school classroom drama, and Christian mysticism. I suppose this might have contemporaneously been seen as an artsy deconstruction of mech shows, I don't think it has aged that well and always seems on the edge of becoming intesting or exciting rather than actually getting there.\n\n**A Murder at the End of the World**(Disney+ Canada/FX) Gave up on this one before the finale. Looking for a top-shelf murder mystery that works in cutting-edge science/philosophy, tech culture, and a young and attractive female protagonist? Try **Devs**(FX), this show wasted a compelling setup, a high-powered cast, and what looks like a very healthy shooting budget with spectacularly awful failures in directing, editing, and narrative development. TV used to require showrunners to hone their craft banging out seasons of network sitcoms or dramas, in the streaming era there are lots of chances given to creative teams who don't seem have the basics down, and this show seems like very much one of them. Too bad.\n\n**Squid Game: The Challenge**(Netflix) My wife and I aren't reality-watchers at all but this was dumb fun and easy to binge in a couple of sittings. Not interested in a second season but the Battle Royale concept is just so intrinsically compelling it makes it hard to stop watching anything that utilizes it.",

Jason Alan Carvell did OK but just did not have the same screen presence or intensity in the role as Thatch. \n\n**Overlord s3** - I felt like this was the weakest season yet.

The actor playing William Wales (Prince William) is terrific and gives us a bit of insight into the otherwise very opaque, proper, and distant real life figure. But I like...don't care? That's kind of how I feel about most of the Diana-less show post-Diana years, TBH. I really think they needed to find a focus on either world events, inside palace life--not just this constant low-key fretting about \"modernizing\" the palace but nay, we refuse because ancestral swan keepers are just so touching! I smell Julian Fellows all over this--if not him, someone who really likes and looks up to him. Look, I love Julian's work. It's escapist fun. But it's not suited for real-life events. \n\n**Dexter** (Showtime via Paramount Plus) oof I dunno. This show feels like it's pandering to the worst possible impulses in everyone. Like the leering at gore and serial killers, the belief that someone could be clever enough to be a \"good guy\" killer, that we the audience know how creepy Dexter is but that the doofs in the show don't...and so on. The show breaks its own arm patting itself on the back for breaking paradigms and subverting expectations left and right. I find it honestly rather repellent and skin crawling. This is a show about a man who finds sexual satisfaction--and make no mistake, the show telegraphs that CLEARLY-- from **torturing others and killing them**. I kept on thinking \"what if he's MISTAKEN. What if he kills (through extended American Psycho style torture!) the wrong person?!\" I watched 2 episodes before moving on to something else. Also get stuffed Deb. No one's buying it. \n\n**Murder at the End of the World** Hulu FX. Brit Marling is SO close to being perfect--as an actor and a director. But she has a tendency to be predictable and ham fisted in her ideas and execution and lack subtly and/or nuance. I love this show but like...having the ominously intense billionaire actually be a villain (I guess a twist could be coming via \"unreliable narrator/storyteller\" but even that is too predictable!) feels stale. Like I get there's really no ethical good-guy billionaires but having the \"underdog\" characters sit around pontificating about climate change and terrible capitalism like freshman in a college bull sesh is not...quite doing it for me.

Master chief and crew drop in from outer space, land on the ground, Chef lands on an enemy and says \"afternoon\". That scene right there should be redone 100x and theres your halo show right there imo.\n\nIf it were up to me I'd never flesh out Cheif or even take off the mask. Gotta keep the larger than life mystique. I wouldn't make him the main character. Id make him like the terminator where normal human protagonist carries the show and Cheif hangs around and says one liners and goes around killing everything.

They like action but I don't. My main requirement is shows with prominent female characters who are interesting/well written. Our only common shows are WWDITS and The Boys (which I'm mainly only watching for annie, kimiko, and maeve.)\n\nedit to add: shows they dislike/don't want to watch are doctor who, community, yellowjackets, house of the dragon, sharp objects, grey's anatomy, the walking dead, angel the series\n\nshows they liked: brooklyn 99, what we do in the shadows, buffy the vampire slayer but it frustrates them a lot, the boys, the queen's gambit",

If you like animation period I recommend.\n\nIt\u2019s a family show but with deep emotional themes that adults can appreciate. There\u2019s no need to know anything about or even like Star Trek.\n\nIt has strong and complex female characters but the other characters are also beautifully written. The writers are smart and weave complete and satisfying storylines. If you finish an episode with questions they are answered in the following episode. \n\nThe music by Nami Melumad and Michael Giacchino is incredible and full of character perfectly suited to animation. The visuals give me chills at times with awe inspiring landscapes and gorgeous colouring. \n\nThe second half of the season definitely amps up and it just gets better with each episode so stick with it through the season if you can. You end up caring for these animated characters immensely (I cried a few times in the finale).\n\nSmart, satisfying and beautiful is Prodigy in a nutshell. So if you\u2019re looking for something to watch these holidays I can only recommend Prodigy.",
