Michael Imperioli just steals every scene, he kind of channels his inner Christopher Moltisanti in this role haha. Also I love the cameos from the  people who created the show Corporate (Matt and Jake). \n\n**Bad Sisters** \\- Only 3 episodes in and enjoying it so far!

Well written, well acted, not gratuitous, feels realistic and organic. Catherine Cawood needs to be on all kinds of best character lists. Love that they included the Gallaghers as well instead of letting them disappear the way shows often do. I get why writers let characters have friends because the plot demands it and then drop them as soon as they're no longer needed. I do. But I prefer it when they do this\r  \n\r  \n*Binging*\r  \n\r  \n**Mr. Mercedes:** I had for some reason mixed this up with some other Mr. \\[whatever\\] show and thought it was going to be about some hitman, and then the mercedes arrived, shining its headlights rather menacingly at a crow, and I realized that, oh, there's gonna be murder, all right, but not of the hitman variety.

The first series is based on the first book (*Mr. Mercedes*), which is a straight-up crime thriller *without* supernatural elements. But it gets more Stephen King-supernatural with the second and third books (*Finders Keepers* and *End of Watch)* which were made into the third and second seasons, respectively.  \n\nIt's also fun comparison viewing to see the other Holly Gibney on HBO's *The Outsider.* :)\n\nI also need to mention this show surprised the hell out of me by being showrun by [David E. Kelly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005082/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) (who I swore off after *Chicago Hope* and *Ally McBeal* :-).

And there's no other show out there there that looks or sounds like it. It feels like an endless barrage of love letters to many things, and above all, film. The way they collage, break the fourth-wall, shoot on film/analog video, etc. It's all an abundance of creativity and risk taking that pays off over and over again.\n\nI loved listening to [the podcast this week for episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4eitzn1xKo) where cinematographer/director Todd Benhazl pointed out that with the Larry Bird flashbacks, they were going for a big cinematic/western showdown feel and changed the aspect ratio and shot it 16mm (down and gritty), anamorphic widescreen.\n\nI was laughing like a loon when I spotted them slipping in a reel-change mark on one of those flashback scenes (a trick I noted Fincher did with *Mank*). Benhazl *loves* film the way Tarantino and Fincher love film.\n\nI also *have* to point  out that the games/practices are primarily shot by a former Xsports camera guy [who's rollerblading with a handheld Arri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrwHs_j-1w).",

It pains me to say this, but I truly think shows/films are better served when he\u2019s in the supporting cast and not a lead. It\u2019s not that he gives a bad performance as Nucky. It\u2019s a fine performance. But the BE supporting cast consistently outshines him in almost every scene. That said, the world building and art direction/costuming for this series is phenomenal.",

Hope they continue with homages to film directors/genres.\n\n**Justified: Primeval**: As this approaches the finale, I find I am enjoying each episode more and more.

Very much anticipating each new episode.\n\n**Reservation Dogs**: Gonna be sad to see this show go. The integration of Native American culture is always so well done and I will miss it.\n\n**Veronica Mars**: Finished binging this the other day after 2 weeks of watching. I disagree with all the disappointment of the s04 finale because >!Logan died.!< I went on r/veronicamars to see what people thought and there's a lot of anger that >!the bomb in the car that killed Logan didn't make sense after the bomb at the event was found and foiled. They mention that there was no way authorities missed the backpack in the car after Patton Oswalt was arrested. I think Patton's character wasn't responsible for the final bomb and it's another case of \"who really did it?\". Personally I think it was the Mexican hitmen tying up loose ends, since one  of them mentions earlier in the season about someone moving their car for the street cleaners. The bomb went off when Logan went out to move the car for the street cleaners.!<\n\n**The Detour**: Started this one this week and already into season 2. Really liking this road trip/dysfunctional family series. Feels like a more involved version of the movie, We're the Millers.\n\n**Top Boy**: Watched the pilot of this British crime-drama. Reminds me of Gomorrah. Think I will continue with it.\n\n**The Wrong Mans**: Also watched the first episode of this crime-comedy.

Everything feels accurate to a documentary; the details of the history of the LoL esports culture are nailed to a T, to the point where if you are a fan you'll catch tons of wonderful references, and if you're not, you'll still be impressed by just how massive this esports culture has become.\n\nThe humor is accurate to gamer culture, and takes a few potshots at the \"nerds\" that these characters are. But make no mistake, it doesn't punch down on them; their flaws are their own, and their struggles are palpable. I was so genuinely attached to these douchebags by the end of the season that I was pumping my fist at their achievements, and groaning alongside their failures. These characters are believably people: the most egotistical amongst the group is also the most loyal, his ego coming from a place of hurt. The most pensive and quiet is also the most selfish, even if his skill far surpasses the rest of the group. Each of the characters, from the team members, to the coaches, to the families are portrayed as flawed people, good and bad, with only a few cardboard cutouts added in to be antagonists in the story.\n\nIt's truly something special, and it's a massive shame that it was cancelled, even if anyone could see it coming from miles away. I mean, who on Paramount+ even gives a crap about esports? But it's a brisk watch, 10 episodes, and you'll be left sated and thrilled all the same, even if you may struggle at first to understand what the hell people are talking about with their game terms. If you're a fan of League, however, you'll fall right in love, between the humor, the energy, the deep cuts, the cameos, and the flashbacks to the pieces of League of Legends' past that made me feel nostalgic to my earlier years.\n\nIt's not a must-watch, as it's definitely not for everyone, but I guarantee that if you do watch it, you'll leave wanting more.",

Just really smart fun.  \n\nSame with **What We Do In The Shadows** \\- they just keep things fun.  Great season.  \n\nI also started watching **Expedition X**, which is Josh Gates produced and hosted because I love Josh Gates.  This show has two \"investigators\" (let's put a pin in that one for now) in the field and Gates is behind the desk sending Phil Torres (actual scientist) and Jessica Chobot (famous for licking a PSP and for hosting The Nerdist News) into the field to investigate paranormal phenomena.  As with most paranormal investigative shows - I have some notes. \n\nFirst - they never seem to spend enough time doing the investigation.  Now, I know that paranormal investigations are largely dull.  Most of the time you are just sitting in the dark waiting for something to happen.  But they spend maybe a half hour sitting in the dark.  That's not enough time for anything to actually happen, usually, but in TV time - all kinds of stuff happens because - TV. \n\nSecond, when something paranormal does happen, Jessica overreacts.  She jumps, calls Phil on the walkie, ruins the mood and then she scurries away in her RIDICULOUSLY TIGHT PANTS.  My husband loves this part.  I do not.  \n\nThird, there's not enough science.  That's why I like Gates' other shows - lots of history and archeology and he makes it interesting.  Expedition X is less that and much less Gates.  The scientist, Phil Torres is an actual biologist!  He knows stuff!  And they never let him talk or explain things long enough in favor of Jessica Stretchy Pants talking over him about psychic phenomena or electromagnetic fields and how she totally believes every weird story anyone tells her.  She's always all in - no skepticism and she's not willing to listen to Phil's skepticism and you know, actual background in science.  She's too excited and I kind of wish she would tone it down a notch or two.  \n\nAlso - these two have very little interpersonal chemistry.  I'm not sure Phil cares that Jessica is even there and I'm not sure I do either.  Phil could carry this show and it would still be fun to watch.\n\nFun Fact: Watch this show and impress your friends by telling them that Phil Torres' sister is Eve Torres' WWE Diva Champion.",

And it's what the last SAG+WGA strike gained back in the '60s. :)  It's always about what happens *after* the initial release of a movie or tv show.\n\nIt's not viewership-based, according to that WGA document (the residuals survival guide). It's how much the production company was paid-based and/or a fixed base amount. So basically, it's paid depending on how often it's shown and how much the broadcast/studio agreed for the license price. Similarly, DVD and Blu-Ray releases also pay residuals.\n\nResiduals were the basic way that writers/actors can survive the periods of unemployment between projects. Money can come in at regular intervals even when they're not actively working on a project.\n\nStreaming, of course, changed all that.  The license fees for broadcast/cable/satellite second-runs and media release/sales have all gone down because streaming's eroded the customer base. And streaming calculates residuals differently. In essence, nobody's getting paid any more for a successful show than an unsuccessful one; the residual checks have mostly dried up. Which is why the strike demands with both the WGA and SAG that emphasize residuals and the need for more transparency in how the residuals are calculated.",

It honestly might be the worst show I've seen in terms of how the soundtrack is applied and edited. \n\n\nThe songs themselves are good to great. The selection itself isn't the issue. But the excessive way the songs are used is kind of ridiculous. It doesn't help that the soundtrack is mostly based on the folk/rock/indie genre so they blend in with each other after a while, until everything starts to sound generic and mind-numbingly boring. So many back to back montage scenes, so many establishing shots, all played with one rock song after another.\n\n\nIt's just not fun to watch because nothing happens. I don't mind that there is little to no plot, I enjoy character driven shows. But when there is no character work going on either, then what the hell am I watching? The excessive usage of music in The Bear often feels like the showrunners are saying \"hey look at us, we know the coolest songs from the coolest artists, aren't we the coolest?\" It feels self-indulgent and pointless.",
