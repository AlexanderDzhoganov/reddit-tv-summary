            "body": "***Navajo Police: Class 57*** (HBO/Max). A powerful 3-part documentary on a class of police trainees in the Navajo Nation, outlining just how squeezed the Navajo police and the entire Din\u00e9 reservation society is on all sides and how deeply the odds are stacked against them. If you've been watching *Dark Winds* and *Reservation Dogs,* you may want to catch the non-fiction side of things.\n\n***Nature: The Platypus Guardian*** (PBS). Originally an ABC documentary about a citizen scientist/photographer who learns about the near-urban platypuses of Hobart and gets involved in habitat protection activism. That was nice and heartwarming, but I was there for all the platypus action and footage, which is amazing. They are really weird fascinating critters about which I realized I knew nothing. Now I know more.\n\n***Annika*** (PBS *Masterpiece*) Season 2 is back. It's been a little weird to see S5 of *Unforgotten* without Nicola Walker, only to have Nicola Walker pop up as the detective in *Annika* the following week. :)  Also fun to have [one of my favorite Radio 4 dramas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b049fg98/episodes/player) turned into a tv series.\n\n***Found*** (NBC). NBC is killing it for me this fall season with pretty much the only new first-run scripted dramatic content on broadcast. :) This one is turning out to be stronger than I'd assumed it would be, so I think I'm sticking with it. It's a missing-persons crime procedural with the twist that the main investigator is not a cop (because: PoC cases get overlooked by cops, so she steps in to fill the gap) and she was once an abductee herself, who turned the tables on her abductor and keeps him chained up to use as a consultant in the old consult-a-serial-killer trope. This one may be more for the *Criminal Minds* crowd.\n\n***The Irrational*** (NBC) Another off-season development show that's earning the ratings by simply being new. :) If you liked *Elementary, Lie to Me,* or *Instinct,* this one might be for you. Jesse L. Martin plays a behavioral science professor who consults for the FBI.  It's got that nice middling-light tone of procedural with a memorable genius character as the center.\n\n***Spy x Family*** (Hulu/Crunchyroll) is back for its second season. Feel I should mention this since it's not one of the shows that pops up on lists or top tiles. :D Hulu is misnumbering the episodes, though. They went from s1e25 to s2e26. \\[eyeroll\\].\n\nHolding-steady-and-not-much-to-say-about-them shows for me: ***Loki*** (Disney+), ***Our Flag Means Death*** (Max), ***Doom Patrol*** (Max), ***Quantum Leap*** (NBC), ***Magnum PI*** (NBC), ***Bob's Burgers*** (Fox), ***Transplant*** (NBC), and ***Welcome to Wrexham*** (FX/Hulu).\n\nErrata: in an earlier upcoming list, I mentioned *Pantheon* S1 & S2 were going to be on Amazon Prime. My source (futoncritic) only later updated that to be Amazon Prime only in Australia and New Zealand. Apologies. I'm also disappointed.\n\nUpcoming for me through November:\n\n* 10/25: *Nature:* [*Spy in the Ocean*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU_orZZ_IIs) (PBS). That BBC documentary where they hide cameras inside animal-shaped robots? It's back and underwater this time. Hope they kept the David Tennant voiceover. edited to add: crap, they didn\u2019t.\n* 10/27. [*Fellow Travelers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zI9UwYNQo) (Paramount+ with Showtime).\n* 10/27. *Penn & Teller Fool Us S10* (CW). Sans Alyson this season.\n* 10/29.

[*The Killer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs1epO_zLG8) (Netflix). David Fincher adapting a bande dessin\u00e9e *(Le Teur)*? I'm in.\n* 11/12. [*Beacon 23*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFF22Mgyvzc) \\[MGM+\\]. Mostly curious since this was going to be a Spectrum Original, it's SF, and it stars Lena Headey.\n* 11/14. [*Murder at the End of the World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnPl4PuNb5U) (Hulu).\n* 1/16. [*Julia* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q66tXmNjQV4) (Max). Probably my most-anticipated show. I loved S1 so much. Trivia note: the showrunner is Chris Keyser, who was the main WGA spokesperson on the negotiation committed during the strike.\n* 11/16. [*The Crown* S6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykn9pD9H56U) (Netflix). four episodes now, six later (Dec 14).\\[eyeroll\\].\n* 11/17.

I just planned on sampling the first episode but I was hooked; in one sitting, I ended up binge-watching all three episodes that are out so far. This show is sooo good.\n\nI liked retro setting of the 1950s dealing with a genius chemist woman who does cutting-edge research, and apparently has a cooking show? The show's setting and focus on a genius woman reminded me of the *Queen's Gambit*, which I also really liked.\n\nWhat really hooked me was the behind-the-scenes segment at the end of first episode, where you see the two main actors receiving a cooking lesson. Brie Larson and Lewis Pullman actually make one the dishes of from the show, as they take instructions from the chef that actually made the recipe.  The show's website even publishes the [recipes from the show](https://lessonsinchemistryrecipes.com/recipes).  It was unusual to have a behind-the-scenes segment like that, and I knew then that this show wouldn't be your typical show so I kept on watching.\n\nI was right as episode three features a very unusual narrator, which was a total surprise and it helped to add some humor to balance out the ending of the previous episode. I can see why the book was so popular.  I usually watch sci-fi and mystery shows, so it was unexpected that I would like this show so much. Looking forward to the new episode this Friday.",

Langella was removed from the project during filming, and some scenes had to be refilmed.\n\nFrank said he was [\"cancelled\" for telling off color jokes ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/frank-langella-responds-netflix-the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-firing-1235141616/)\n\nCast members claimed he made the set toxic [with his \"jokes\" and made costars uncomfortable](https://deadline.com/2022/05/frank-langella-fired-the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-netflix-series-details-1235029281/)\n\n\nRule of thumb: If a Mike Flanagan series has creepy cats in it, the series will be entertaining.

I hope it becomes popular; it truly is gorgeous and well done. \n\nI wont give away too much story wise, but the show (so far) follows three groups. One pair of people, one woman and a robot/ai, and one lone survivor, who all crashed their pods in different regions and are now trying to find their way back to the ship. There is definitely an element of suspense; I find myself on the edge of my seat the whole episode. And im desperate for the next ep to come out. I want it now. \n\nI wouldnt describe this show as \"for the feint of heart\" because of the body horror aspect. But it's equally whimsical and magical, if not more so.

It also takes a while to get going, so it's a slow burn at the start as it introduces all the characters, but it'll start moving at a frantic pace eventually. It's completed with 3 seasons.\n\n**Foundation on Apple TV**. The second season is especially good, improving on the first and it's my favorite new sci-fi show now.\n\n**For All Mankind and Silo are also on Apple TV** and are sci-fi. Silo is a post-apocalyptic show based on series of popular books. For All Mankind is set in an alternate timeline, starting the 1960s where Russia was the one to first set on the moon, lauching a decades long space race between US, Russia and other countries as they expand beyond the moon.  Each season covers a different decade, and the fourth season is about to come out next month, set in the 2000s.\n\n**Battlestar Galactica (2004 reboot)** \\-- a really good space opera. It's the previous show that was made by the creator of For All Mankind.\n\n**Love Death + Robots on Netflix** \\-- I loved this animated sci-fi anthology show. Many of the episodes are based on sci-fi short stories.\n\n**Black Mirror on Netflix** \\-- another anthology sci-fi show but it's live-action, not animated. A lot of creepy dark stories here (but some are uplifting).

The creators previous work, the password for the Numbers online group chat is Baccano! \n\nThose two lovely morons are kind of the constantly recurring goofballs. In Baccano!

The first episode gives you a seeming protagonist but then it turns out to be an ensemble show and that protagonist is missing for long stretches. \n\nPeople talk about the big three shows that Mappa was working on at the same time, and I seem to like them in reverse order of what is popular. **Hell's Paradise** was my favorite (though it got a bit weaker towards the end of the season) and seems fraught with potential. An executioner escorts her prisoner to an island to find a potion of immortality? And the animate is beautiful IMO. \n\nMy second favorite is **Chainsaw Man**. Sometimes it can be a bit hard to follow but I do sort of love the attitude of the main characters. It kind of feels like what I thought JJK was going to be as the at least we focus on the protagonist a lot more. And yes, Power is a draw. I'm not even sure it is for the reasons people think though. She has 'annoying sister who doesn't clean up after herself or flush the toiler' energy. But she is honest. Well sometimes. She seems like a very real person, especially considering she's a demon. So absolutely the show would be lesser without Power. \n\nThen you have JuJutsu Kaisen. I admit I not 100% caught up (I am into the Shibuya ark and have watched everything previous including the movie) and there are parts that I like. Other parts kind of put me to sleep. Understanding the politics and the different families and all the idiosyncraties of how magic works can get tedious. Also while I don't hate the character of Gojo, I am not enthralled by him or anything. I'd rather get more of Yuji's story and move what I would consider the main plot forward.",

Not a fan of sitcoms, action, drama, reality tv,  unless it's satire. 2023 Shows that I watched or still watching and I find interesting (not always perfect) \n\n1. \"What We Do in the Shadows\" - 5th season, the only show that consistently gets better \n2. \"Sex Education\" - new season, big changes, new characters, closures and humor\n3. \"Slip\" - fantasy, surreal tv series with good comedy bits about self-search \n4. \"I'm a Virgo\" - new take on superheroes, surreal, focus on youth and identity politics.\n5. \"Why didn't they ask Evans\" - well-done british mystery with humor and style\n6. \"Changeling\" - book adaptation, magic realism, heavy topic, visually impressive\n7. \"Gen V\" - good spin of The Boys with focus on youth, social media, mental issues \n8. \"Florida Man\" - good mystery, crime, with cynical humor and an interesting portrayal or  Florida as a state of mind, + hot actors\n\nThere are some shows I watched and thought are \"ok\", might list them in next post. If  any of you think I would enjoy a show not mentioned here, lemme know:)",

There\u2019s always that question of how close to adhere to the source material when modernizing an adaptation like this and I think this was generally handled the right way in that it did not try to hide it\u2019s references and decided to mostly just call them out. \n\nMy one complaint would be that \n>!Verna called out their crime so specifically it left no wiggle room with whether or not it was real which  made Roderick\u2019s explanation of a shared delusion that they then just forgot about afterwards kind of hand-wavey.!<\n\n>!I think it would have worked better if instead Verna was more vague about what she explicitly knew about their crime. When offered the deal the siblings would have still accepted and instead of showing them turn around and see that the bar didn\u2019t exist immediately after walking out maybe have them wake up at home groggy and hungover. This would have made their questions and doubts about what\u2019s going on with the kids later in life more credulous and also would have worked well with Rodericks confession that he knew his drugs were harmful but didn\u2019t care. !<\n\nWhile this did detract slightly from my appreciation of the ending the performances, ultimately overrode any issues I had. They were strong across-the-board. Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood are rightfully getting a lot of attention but I\u2019d also like to give praise to both Samantha Sloyan and Henry Thomas( who I\u2019ve had mixed feelings about in the other Flanagan series.) Sloyan is brilliant as someone who think there and complete control of their feelings but of course isn\u2019t. I especially like the scene she had with Juno. \n\nSo overall I\u2019d definitely recommend this and rank it just below Hill House in terms of Flanagan\u2019s series.",

            "body": "**The Diplomat**\n\nThis was a pretty enjoyable series, largely helped by the strength of its cast - particularly Keri Russell and Rufus Sewell as the main couple.  The main conflict was pretty interesting, seeing them try to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack, through more diplomatic means than a lot of other shows with that kind of plot.\n\n**Justified City Primeval**\n\nI wasn't really sure what to expect from this going into it, but I was looking forward to it either way.  It's best to take this as its own series rather than a direct continuation, since most of the cast and setting is new, outside of Rayland of course.  Personally, I'd say it's not quite as good as the original, but still very enjoyable on its own merits.  I did like the story with main antagonist Clement, and seeing Rayland get further drawn into the Detroit police investigation.  Looking into it, it doesn't seem like it's been renewed or canceled (maybe after the actors strike ends?), but the set-up to season 2 really has me hoping for more.\n\n**The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon**\n\nI thought this was a very enjoyable season overall.  Like with Dead City, I'd say it works in large part because of how focused it is on one story and specific characters.  And Daryl's relationship with the new characters was pretty well done, especially Isabelle.  There was also plenty of good zombie action throughout the season.  And the ending left me with fewer reservations for season 2 than Dead City's did.\n\n**Batman The Animated Series season 2** (AKA The Adventures of Batman & Robin)\n\nA great continuation of the first season.  I do think I prefer season 1, if only because the high episode count allowed for a wider variety of stories and villains, but I thought they did a very good job building off that season's strengths.  I also thought the production value seemed to be a bit more consistently strong.\n\nAlso, one thing I noticed as the season progressed is how there was a recurring theme of villains being given a second chance.  And while on paper this seems like it could be a bit redundant, they made it work due to the strong writing and acting.\n\n**Star Trek Prodigy**\n\nI've actually rewatched this season 2 times recently - first when it released digitally on Amazon, and then again through the Blu-Rays.  (And yes, I do plan to go through it one more time when it releases on Netflix, to help support it on there).  I love the way they establish the characters, and use them to explore the Star Trek universe in a way that feels fresh, while largely staying true to the spirit of the franchise (and feeling more and more \"Star Trek\" as the season goes along).\n\nOne thing I wanted to mention:  My first rewatch of the season on Amazon was actually a bit different, in that I actually watched them in a pretty random order.  And honestly, I was surprised at just how much a lot of the episodes could hold up on their own like that.  Now, there is the caveat of a period of adjustment in the first few minutes of an episode, as most episodes at least start and end with scenes that carry on the serialized story, but once you get into the meat of that episode's story, a lot of them can be just as enjoyable a more stand-alone episode from other shows.  The biggest exceptions I can think of being \"Terror Firma\" (since it's directly continued from \"Dream Catcher\"), the 2-part mid-season finale \"A Moral Star,\" and the 2-part finale \"Supernova.\"\n\n**Very Short Treks**\n\nI was a bit mixed on these overall.  When I first watched first episode I kind of enjoyed its dumb humor, although I thought it was a bit too repetitive, and my opinion quickly soured after sitting on it for a while.  And the next couple episodes weren't that good either IMO.\n\nI might have stopped there if the 4th episode, \"Holograms All the Way Down\" wasn't written by Aaron Waltke, my favorite writer from Prodigy, and it did not disappoint.  I liked how it stemmed from a specific (infamous) moment of Star Trek history, and really blew it out to ridiculous proportions.  Admittedly it still is a bit repetitive, but in a way I feel enhances the humor, rather than makes it wear thin.\n\nAnd the last episode, \"Walk, Don't Run,\" initially had me worried it would be a repeat of the first short, but the second half turned it around for me.  It's silly and bizarre in a way that may not appeal to everyone, but I liked it, and it had a pretty good theme in the end.  I still prefer the 4th episode, but this was a solid not to end things on IMO.\n\nOverall I still feel like this was a bit of a failed experiment, but one that did have its moments in the end.  This very well could be a one-off, and I wouldn't mind if it was, but if they *did* decide to bring it back, I hope they take the feedback into consideration, and look at what actually worked.",

If you're familiar with the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, you can get an idea of what the show is like, as each death is a modern twist on one of his stories.  The episodes are titled after a story.  What you might do is watch the first episode, which is relatively light, and go from there.  Mike Flanagan generally relies much more on suspense and creepiness than jump scares and blood; I'm not much of a horror fan myself, but I trust anything he does to be good.",

Also, there is no SA even though it might be typical to see it in a show like this.\n\n**Traitors on Peacock** \\-- even if you're not into reality TV, but it seems you like mysteries, give this show a try. A group of people stay at an English castle and figure out who is \"murdering\" one of them each night.  The main draw is watching these people get things hilariously wrong, even though they feel so certain they are right. Pick a version and watch it: US, UK, AUS. The Canada version is beginning to air I think.\n\n**Cobra Kai on Netflix** \\-- Very fun show with lots of 80s nostalgia but updated for modern times. There is punching and kicking as because the kids train to fight in competition, and some over-the-top school brawls, but the tone is similar to the stuff you see in Stranger Things. This show both made me laugh and cry.\n\n**Russian Doll on Netflix** \\-- if you want to see more of Natasha Lyonne from Poker Face, this mystery / timeloop show is really good.

I\u2019d say I preferred Midnight Mass more too. I didn\u2019t like the style of horror also - it was just about who could get the most grotesque/gory death. Rather than actual eeriness/creepy. Also it was pretty obvious who Verna was by the 2nd episode and why she was doing what she was doing. \n\nAlso finished: **Painkiller: The Tylenol Murders** a 5-part documentary on Paramount+, about a series of deaths in 1982 which occurred when it was discovered someone had laced the pils with cyanide. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this series it kind of went in circles and veered off from the main topic and it had too many episodes. Three episodes would\u2019ve been enough to tell the story.\n\nAlso watched: **The Devil on Trial**, a docu-movie on Netflix - what the 3rd Conjuring movie was based on. It was ok, the oldest brother basically refutes everything in the doc saying he found evidence his mother drugged their food when they were children and the drug she used has side effects if used over a long period of time. \n\nYet to watch: \n* **One Piece s1.**\n* **Sex Education s4.**\n* **Elite s7.**\n* **The Night Logan Woke Up (mini).**\n\nAlso last week I recommended **Last Stop Larrimah: Murder Down Under** a HBO doc and I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s been added to Netflix internationally. So if your looking for something to watch on Netflix I\u2019d recommend that.",

It was Moffat's first time *t*aking a classic literary Victorian horror/monster story and modernizing it. James Nesbitt and Gina Bellman were awesome in it, and I always appreciated that Denis Lawson got to play a bad guy (I still think of him as Wedge Antilles first and foremost).",

Keith Carradine *is* Wild Bill Hickock, his arc is fairly accurate on the show as well. \n\nDavid Milch the creator actually pitched it as a series set in Rome but it just so happened HBO already had that show in production. He wanted to show how law and social order forms out of chaos so he called an audible during the pitch and picked the Deadwood gold rush era as the setting for the show and it worked out beautifully.\n\nAside from that The Tudors, John Adams and maybe War and Peace (2016) would fit? Historical accuracy is questionable at best for The Tudors but the acting is top notch. Really hard to find good shows set before the 1800s.\n\nThe Bureau is great and might satisfy the spy themed itch.

It's the story of the manhunt by Viktor Burakov for the real life serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo, in the Soviet Union. Where the political line was that serial killers were a decadent Western phenomenon and did not exist in the Soviet Union... Again, someone fighting the odds to fix something horrendous against a system that's actively making it nearly impossible to accomplish the task.\n\n[*Black Sails*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aigIJGeykI) (Starz) is the show we shove at people who want more *GoT* brutal court intrigue. :)  It's both a prequel to Treasure Island as well as incorporating a number of real historical pirates (or at least their names) into the narrative. It was easier to watch when it was on Hulu, but it's still out there. It starts out with some Michael Bay excesses, but eventually the writing kicks in and takes off like a bat out of hell.\n\n[*Turn: Washington's Spies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY52rx_8iDE) (AMC+) was showrun by Craig Silverstein (*Nikita, The Dead Zone),* and it's American Revolutionary War and spy craft combined, with both fictional and historical characters intertwined.\n\nMay not be your thing but [*Gentleman Jack*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uBYRcP44M4) (Max) is a BBC/HBO show written by Sally Wainwright (*Happy Valley, Last Tango in Halifax*) about the real life 19th century industrialist, land owner, mountaineer and lesbian, Anne Lister, owner of Shibden Hall. It being Sally Wainwright, it's not at all high-falutin' as British period drama goes.\n\nIf you are okay with high-falutin' British period drama, then maybe [*The English Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBOlhdSYhv8) on Netflix might be fun: it's about the origins of professional football in the UK and combines a sports underdog story with the period drama thing.  It's Julian Fellowes who also does *Downton Abbey* and *The Gilded Age.*\n\nNational Geographic/Hulu/Disney+'s *Genius* is an anthology series, where each season is about a different famous person. It's executive produced by Ron Howard. [Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SICLBlHizUY) was Albert Einstein; [Season 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbNwQog4Ro) was Pablo Picasso (played by Antonio Banderas); [Season 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryGpdVuuq_Y) was Aretha Franklin (played \\[and sung\\] by Cynthia Erivo). And the upcoming Season 4 will be Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.\n\nAs for Roman Empire stuff, if you've got AcornTV, I recommend *I, Claudius.* [So does George R.R. Martin](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/09/10/c-c-claudius-aka-i-clavdivs/).  :)\n\nSpy series, I say go LeCarre. *The Night Manager* \\[Britbox\\] and *Little Drummer Girl* \\[AMC+\\];  if you want to go old school *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* and *Smiley's People* if you can find them.

Maybe they should have stopped at the end of season 5 instead. I get what they were aiming for and it works, maybe it was ok watching one episode a week when it came out, but watching it now even 1-2 episodes a night was a downer.  \n\n\n >!There are several episodes in a row where Tony considers killing some of his long-term guys for stupid things: Paulie, Bobbie, Christopher. In earlier seasons Tony showed much more restraint regarding Pussy or Richie or even Ralphie, but season 6 Tony is just unhinged.!<\\\n\n>!I didn't enjoy the fact that all of the characters are shown only when relevant to Tony's story. Besides the Ben Kingsley episode, I felt a need in season 6 for more escape from Tony's gloom - I would have liked more episodes like Pine Barrens or D-Girl or more Meadow time like we had in season 3. !<",
