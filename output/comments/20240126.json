Haven\u2019t really connected with the show although I\u2019ve tried. But season 5 really got me. The storyline was tight. They kept it small and the writing was wicked sharp. But the real selling point is the casting. Juno Temple is excellent. She\u2019s so watchable and does the Wide eyed babe in the woods with the North Dakota accent perfectly and drops into the dead serious don\u2019t F with me! Moments perfectly. I was absolutely invested in seeing how events would unfold. Jennifer Jason Leigh is great as the matriarch you *think* has only one speed.. full throttle b**ch, and Jon Hamm plays the most detestable version of himself I\u2019ve seen yet. \nIf you haven\u2019t seen Fargo skip seasons 1 through 4  and go straight to 5.

The premise on imdb/google does it a disservice (I ignored  this for a month or so because the premise didn't inspire interest)\n\nThe first episode hooks you, the rest of it reels you in. The ending is satisfying and the 2nd season starts out maintaining the quality. So far very happy and excited to see where this goes\n\nEdit: Finished it. Episodes 4 5 could have been better (more fleshed out maybe) but the ending is good. (Again could've been better if they gave more details but yeah)",

The characters are frustrating & the story seems to get a bit directionless at times, but I still liked it.\u00a0\n\n**White Lotus, season 2 (Max)**: After a discussion here, decided to give season 2 a go even though I didn\u2019t like season 1. I think season 2 was much better. Although the characters were still a bit unlikeable, they were a better spectrum of unlikeability with some redeeming characteristics. Unlike season 1 where everyone was just set to max insufferableness. I felt more engaged in the various stories where season 1 I just didn\u2019t care - I was neither rooting for or against them. I liked Jennifer Coolidge\u2019s storyline but wish it had been done with someone else (I\u2019m just not a fan of hers), but I\u2019m glad they added in her assistant. I thought that actress was fantastic.\u00a0\n\n**Reservation Dogs, season 2 (Hulu)**: Funny & the kids are great.\u00a0\n\n**Hell\u2019s Kitchen, season 22 (Hulu)**: background watch.

This season has been average. It's not terrible but it's not that enjoyable. The twist of bringing back the vets isn't even that exciting for me since they don't have a chance of getting into the game. Relying heavily on Jay and Michelle for screen time was an odd choice for this year. I have to imagine it's because all the big names are taking a season off before the big Season 40.\n\n**Reacher** | Drama | Prime  \nSeason 2  \n*Episodes completed: 8/8*  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | 77\n\nThat finale was borderline insane. Both in action and believability. For a show that already struggles with decent dialogue or realistic scenarios, that finale was just brutal. Overall, this is an easy watch with solid action.\n\n**The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon** | Drama | AMC+  \nSeason 1  \n*Episodes completed: 6/6*  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | 79\n\nGood show with some really cool episodes/scenes. I wanted a bit more connection for Daryl to the original series, but the overall plot was decent. Hinting at the evolution of the dead was intriguing. I'm starting to wonder if they are going to use all of these spin off series and then connect them all and eventually bring back TWD for 1 more season/movie?\n\n**Russian Doll** | Dramedy | Netflix  \nSeason 2  \n*Episodes completed: 3/7*  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | 77\n\nI'm a fan of Natasha Lyonne so gave this show a shot. First season was an interesting take on the \"Groundhog Day\" plot. Not sure a second season was needed but I'll keep watching.\n\n`REWATCH`\n\n**Daredevil** | Drama | Disney+  \n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 | 92\n\nFinished up season 2 with my girlfriend. It's her first time watching this show. Having Matt Murdock, Frank Castle and Wilson Fisk in the same season is so awesome.\n\n**Fleishman is in Trouble** | Drama | FX / Hulu  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 | 85\n\nGreat show with phenomenal acting.

It consists of eight hour-long episodes, it is quite slow but feels perfectly paced in my opinion, and you'll surely get the hang of it once you're a few episodes in. I loved the top-notch performances, as well as the storytelling having an emphasis on character development. The finale is excellent as well and felt like the show told the story it had set out to say but could be interpreted as something quite different by others watching. Nevertheless a must-watch for all. 9/10\n\n**The White Lotus**: Wow S2 got bonkers towards the end! This season was wildly different from S1 although did carry some aspects of the previous to keep the suspense alive from the beginning till the very end. In my opinion, this is a show that could run for more seasons and would still be entertaining. 9/10. Can't wait for the next season.\n\n**Eastbound & Down**: I enjoyed the first 2 seasons but somehow couldn't as much for S3. The majority of this season is filled with uninspired writing, awful jokes, and half-baked performances. I guess watching a self-centered person like Kenny Powers navigating through his life problems seemed funny enough for 2 seasons but the fatigue could creep in after he keeps making the same mistakes for 3 seasons straight. Now that I have reached thus far I might as well finish the final one sometime soon.",

I think I\u2019d have enjoyed it more if I\u2019d not just recently binged through all three seasons of the excellent The Great. The Serpent Queen was solid but not on that level by a long shot. I feel if they had eliminated the fourth wall breaking stuff and stuck longer with the younger actress playing Catherine I\u2019d have enjoyed it more. All that said, I did think this was solid so I\u2019ll come back for a second season if it finds a new home in the UK after Starz pull the plug on the service. \n\n**Obliterated** - I\u2019m 3/4 of the way through this R-rated Netflix action comedy and have to say I\u2019m finding it pretty fun. Not going to be winning any Emmys but I doubt that was the point. Given this is from the Cobra Kai creators I was not expecting it to be so explicit! I found the start a little cringey but I\u2019m glad I stuck with it as once it settles it is fun and with some truly hilarious moments. \n\nEdit: Just wrapped Obliterated and it was a definitely a fun show. Also worked absolutely perfectly as a limited series with a very satisfying wrap up to the story. If they bring it back for another mission then great but if not this worked perfect as a standalone. Which is not something you can always say about Netflix series. \n\nI\u2019ll probably go with **The Brothers Sun** and **The Winter King** next but I\u2019m also being tempted by **Griselda** and **The Curse**.",

It's an Italian prison (juvie) drama that takes place in Naples and deals with Camorra gangs. Season 1 was very good and really addictive.

For example, there's a scene in which there are quick cuts between a guy committing adultery with his lover while his wife or girlfriend is giving birth to his baby, both of them grunting and grimacing and moving rhythmically in a similar way. Did the creators laugh or cringe while putting this scene together? There are many other over-the-top developments that defy credulity. So I'm going to have to drop it.

Though the 50's were before my time I remember the late 60's and the crazy amount of homophobia that still existed and how being outed could ruin people's lives and careers. The very ending of the show really pays off the price people paid for living their life in the closet. \n\nIt was great to see the dramatization of McCarthy, Roy Cohn and Cohn's determination to keep his lover or romantic obsession (I guess its not definitively known which?) out of the military. Assuming its true I learned things about McCarthy I had NO idea about (I was taught in school that the Edward R Murrow take down of McCarthy was what ruined his career).\n\nAs interesting as the Cohn/McCarthy stuff was, I think the  show did not go far enough into putting the pieces together about how having a shared 'stigma' brought some people with very bad intentions together (like it was a *coincidence* that Cohn and McCarthy were allies who didn't know the other was gay?)\n\nThe evoking of various time periods was mostly stellar, though as with so many shows these days the old age makeup was bizarrely bad.",

Decided to watch the new season because I love The Thing and I love a good \"frozen wilderness\" setting. \nI am not *dis*liking the new season but I am incredibly unimpressed by it and I imagine if it weren't for the setting I would not even bother watching it because it is just such a mess. \n\nI feel like this show was probably a few more episodes *at least* and then was mercilessly butchered in order to fit into this ridiculous 6 episodes length season and somewhere in that process some really dumb choices were made (or forced) in what to keep and what to cut. I think that's why these first two episodes are just so chaotic with introducing a million people every second while also having 7 different plotlines quickly introduced and trampling all over each other. \n\nAnd some of it is also just straight up bad. Like this whole thing with Hank Prior >!who can somehow just disobey a direct order and keep relevant murder files for himself as if he owns them??!< and him obviously being >!catfished!<, why is this even here? How could this possibly be relevant to the larger plot? Stuff like this is just grating to sit through when it feels like the show is wasting time it doesn't have. \n\nIt has been really weird to read other people's comments and how many are just throwing distinct genre definitions like >!cosmic horror!< and >!Lovecraftian horror!< out there to describe season 1 (and I guess this new one as well) and talking as if there is even remotely any doubt about there being anything >!supernatural!< in the first season. I had not seen first season since it came out and I did not remember any of that, so I watched it again now and I do not understand what these people are talking about because it is pretty damn clear what that season is and isn't. \n\nThat's a lot of ranting no one is going to care about, so I guess for what it's worth here is **my recommendation:**  \n\nIf you *haven't* watched any TD, watch the first season because it is still really good. Try the 2nd and 3rd and if you don't like them just skip and go to the new season. I certainly hope you enjoy all of it!\n\nIf you *have* watched the other seasons I think it would behoove a lot of people to go back and at least watch S1 *before* they start rushing into every thread and start saying all kinds of wild shit that is half remembered and half made up in their heads over the last 10 years. So do that and then maybe, *maaaaybe* you too can finally post and die with honor for whatever dumbass brigading side *you* represent in the lame as fuck imaginary \"media culture war\" that for some reason has to play out every single fucking show now.",

Don't get me wrong, it's worth checking out and it feels like a stronger-tier sitcom, but on the edge of feeling generic. The characters become flanderized very quickly and the will-they-or-won't-they is painfully unnecessary. It's very funny, it's got a great cast of characters, and it leans into the setting well. **7.5/10**\n\n**Beef** - Really outstanding, this is just a fantastic show throughout and it manages to take crazy scenarios and one-up them in a well-thought-out way. Absolutely nails the ending, culminating with something really special and meaningful. It was no secret that Yeun was a masterful actor but I was blown away by how good Ali Wong was, you would think she's one of the best actresses in the world if you hadn't seen anything else she's been in. This is going to go down as an all-time great mini-series **9.5/10**\n\n**Shameless** *3 seasons in* - This show is a lot, and only a few seasons in and it feels like every plotline has been rehashed 10 times without any real progress. Everyone and every scenario is cartoonishly overdone, but I'm still having a good time. Idk how to rate this, it's like a fantasy of what people think being lower-class is like with the debauchery cranked to 11 and in a format that is a test of endurance. The acting is all over the place, if you took a shot every time Emmy Rossum's accent changes you would die in the first episode , Jeremy Allen White, Cameron Monaghan and Emma Kenney are all great but their characters are pretty one-note, William H Macy knocks it out of the park for a character with literally 0 redeemable qualities.

And as a Southern Californian it tickles me pink to to see a Spanish crew dressing up the Canary Islands to fake it's 19th century Los Angeles. :)  And sure, most of the accents are Castilian rather than Mexican, but that works just fine for most of the characters. \n\nThe fight sequences are fun and the writing's lively. I'm two episodes in, and finding it great fun. \n\nWhile the Indigenous representation here is probably not that great and Bernardo's mute miming is going to make the signing community very sad at the missed opportunity, I suppose that opens the door for [Disney+'s upcoming *Zorro*](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/game-of-thrones-bryan-cogman-wilmer-valderramas-zorro-series-disney-plus-1235544140/), showrun by *GoT*'s Bryan Cogman to lead the way on representation. :D",

Honestly, the word I would use for it is \"clumsy.\"\n\nThe narrative bounces all over the place, and there is this incessant narration that just doesn't need to be there - when it's not just describing what's happening on the screen, it's giving you information that could have been dropped more naturally in dialogue.  And, because it's bouncing all over the place, you don't really get a feel for the lives of any of the people.

Highly recommended.\n\n* ***Mr Inbetween*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EooRG3QhQOY)) is an crime dramedy that's absolutely stellar. It's hysterical and thrilling and heartbreaking, and only three seasons. Ray Shoesmith is portrayed masterfully by Scott Ryan. It ends perfectly. \n\n* ***Colin From Accounts*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7w04Ii72o0)) is an excellent rom-com with great chemistry and banter between the two leads of Patrick Brammal and Harriet Dyer (who are married IRL). I believe this show's been getting a lot of love recently as it's now available for a broader audience to watch on Paramount+.\n\n* ***A Moody Christmas + The Moodys*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk9KYfJCRXc)) is a comedy limited series that got picked up for an additional season. Also stars Patrick Brammall as one of the leads.\n\n* ***No Activity*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuNBnAotFHc)) is a light and silly, with improved dialogue, I believe. Also stars Patrick Brammall, lol. I think this got spun-off into an American version where Brammall also played a part.\n\n* ***Upright*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPczvcENxGg)) is a lovely dramedy series starring Tim Minchin and Milly Alcock. The first season is pretty fantastic and full of pathos. The second season gets a bit silly, but I'm hoping they'll come back around and do another.\n\n* ***Please Like Me*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38blU2FAjts)) is a lovely little comedy series. I'm only one season deep, but I'm excited to watch more.\n\n* ***Top of the Lake*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuO6_-K5U)) is a mysterious and compelling crime/mystery show that takes place in both New Zealand (first season) and Australia (second season).\n\n* ***Australian Survivor*** ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyrILfskyaE)) is basically eating US Survivor's lunch right now. Two recent seasons, *Brains vs. Brawn* (season 8) and *Heroes vs. Villains* (season 10) are all-time seasons for me, and are like two halves of the same story. And unlike other Aussie shows, there's no shortage of episodes here. You're looking at ~70 minute episodes, and 24 episodes per season. A game of AU Survivor runs for about twice as many days as US Survivor.\n\nAnd a couple honorable mentions for Aussie shows I liked but didn't love:\n\n* ***The Tourist***\n* ***Troppo***\n* ***Black Snow***\n\nAnd shows I've heard good things about (but haven't yet watched):\n\n* ***The Newsreader*** (Edit: Just started watching and it's fantastic. Anna Torv is incredible.)\n* ***Boy Swallows Universe***\n* ***Scrublands***\n* ***Totally Completely Fine***\n* ***Wellmania***\n* ***The Letdown***\n* ***Class of '07***",
