Holy sheet why casting someone like her for a marginal role like this? What a waste of Olivia Colman too.\n\nThis feels like Marvel executives: \"ok guys, when everything was going super good we scheduled 30 shows and 12 movies in three years, yeah I know it was insane but we got some investor money, now we have those contracts to fulfill, we really don't care, we are delaying everything... what we have here? Oh Secret invasion, Skrulls? What are those? Oh, Captain marvel something related? Ok, let's do it quickly, no promotion, silent... 40ish minutes 5 or 6 episodes max, take those 4, 5 actors we have to pay, just don't make them do nothing, so let's hope nobody will watch it and remember it and hope for the best\"",

I love both actors, but Mendelsohn and Jackson are phoning it in, just not a shred of chemistry between what's supposed to be the most important relationship in the series. Really stretching believability to not include the Avengers now as well. It just seems really poorly planned out especially when we all know a reset is coming with the X Men.",

It's a workmanlike supernatural thriller set on an oil rig in the sea, so the unusual setting does major heavy lifting here. \n\n**King of Clones** this rather skimpy Netflix doc is both *fascinating* and confusing. I had to look up the subject to understand the issue and the scandal. It's got some stunning, gorgeous shots and some very lovable characters (Cshillo and his owner, for starters) but a bit too much time was spent on loving shots of various cloned animals and not enough on *exactly* what the main subject did wrong. \n\n**Seinfeld** Season 6--these are the episodes I remember from TBS reruns as a teen. I laughed so hard at the Velvet Fog episode I had tears in my eyes. Some episodes are so packed with jokes and set ups/payoffs my mind is blown. Season 6 is my favorite so far. \n\n**Well-Designed** on HBO. This \"hotel promo channel\" style tv show is soothing, and delightful. It's only like 15 minutes per episode and there's only 4 but I would watch 12 straight hours of this if I could. \n\n**Curious Case of Natalia Grace** on HBO. This feels a little...drawn out for what it is. I also am extremely tired (and triggered, my abusive ex would tell stories in the same self-aggrandizing manner) of Micheal and his histrionics. I bailed about 3 episodes in because I knew the outcome but I may come back to it. \n\nTo watch: \n\n**The Idol** I love a good turkey / flop / cult classic \n\n**The Bear** a show I crammed down everyone's throat last year and #noragrats about that one. \n\n**Yellowjackets Season 2** although I'm hearing very mixed reviews and I'm bummed to see the exact issue I didn't want is the problem (too much time with adults, slow-rolling plot) \n\n**Cruel Summer Season 2** \n\n**Drops of God** for some reason (maybe the subtitles?) this show is not grabbing me.

Six hours later my husband was like \"Are you going to have dinner or....should I just shove a plate under the door?\"\n\nI shouted \"Shove a plate under the door!\" Because I could not tear myself away.

James Gandolfini and Edie Falco belong on the list of best performances of all time. Edie Falco, in particular, was great as Carmela Soprano, and I never felt like she was the token nagging wife for the male character. The children were well written, too. \n\n\nWeekly: **The Other Two**\n\nThe Other Two S03E10 was the series finale, something that was announced yesterday right before the episode aired.

The series finale had so much to do in those 45 minutes and it used every single second perfectly. \n\nTo anyone who isn't familiar with this show, you're seriously missing out on one of the best modern comedies. The jokes are so funny and 'current', the characters are very well written, and it explores a LOT of themes over the course of its three season run. I'm sad it's over but I'm glad it retained quality all the way through.",

For my money, **Snowpiercer** (on Netflix in Canada) was a much superior show with a very similar setting, plot and themes but much more alive, interesting and with a better cast of supporting characters and actors.\n\nYou can do worse but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it unless you are a die-hard genre or Hugh Howey fan.

Steinberg and Dan Shotz. Steinberg co-created and co-ran *Black Sails* and *The Old Man* with Robert Levine, and Shotz was an EP/writer on both shows. My hopes are higher than the average on this one.\n\nStar Wars-wise, I'd recommend *Star Wars: Rebels* because a) it's awesome, and b) it'd be great prep for *Ahsokah* in August, because four of the regular characters from *Rebels* are in the *Ahsoka* trailer. :)\n\nIf you've got toddlers in the mix (or even if you don't), then *Bluey* on Disney+ is awesome for parents. I'd also recommend *American Born Chinese, Muppets Mayhem, Monsters at Work, Gravity Falls* and the documentary, *The Imagineering Story.* But the killer show? is *Ducktales* (2017). Just trust me on this. Unfortunately, they've dumped the other live-action shows I liked (*Mysterious Benedict Society, Big Shot, Mighty Ducks: Game Changers).* But I actually enjoyed *National Treasure: Edge of History.* YMMV. Wildly.\n\n\nNetflix's *Anne With an 'E'* is terrific, but I wouldn't recommend it for really *little* kids. If your kids are okay with gothic humor, then *A Series of Unfortunate Events* on Netflix is very much like the Lemony Snicket books, because Lemony Snicket himself (aka Daniel Handler) did a lot of the adaptation.\n\nAnimation fantasy-wise, on Netflix, for shows that can hold adult as well as kid interest, you can also look at *Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra*, *The Dragon Prince, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,* and the \"Tales of Arcadia\" shows (Guillermo del Toro and Marc Guggenheim), *Trollhunters, 3 Below, Wizards,* and *The Rise of the Titans.* I also highly *highly* recommend *Kid Cosmic.* It's done by Craig McCracken (of *Powerpuff Girls* fame), and it's closed-ended and arced (serialized).\n\nFor Cartoon Network stuff on Max, you could also look at all the Timmverse DCAU shows, as well as *Green Lantern: The Animated Series.* And I loved *We Bare Bears,* but ymmv. If the kids are older and nearly adolescence, I'd also toss in *Over the Garden Wall,* and *Steven Universe.* \n\nI will also say if you like '60s tv, Amazon Prime now has *Wild Wild West* and the classic British show, *The Avengers.* Not sure they're necessarily kid-friendly :), but I remember watching them as a kid.",

Don\u2019t care if S2 ends well, it\u2019s not worth the hours of tedium before to get there\n\nAngel - not as good as Buffy but I still like it enough, it\u2019s pretty good. Cordy still the best character, though I\u2019m not sure about her Karen hair at times\u2026\n\nThe Witcher - those 5 eps were pretty ok but I\u2019m still out with Cavill I think\n\nSilo - great end to the season. Been reading the book today and I really love the writing, it\u2019s very readable\n\nMad Men rw - mad how insanely clear of every show on TV this is still and I haven\u2019t even got to the golden era of S4 and beyond. Just ridiculously good TV\n\nGotham - finished it this week and really enjoyed it as a not so serious watch. The core characters like Penguin, Ed, Gordon, Alfred, Barbara etc really kept my interest. Part of me would have liked a spin off showing David whatshisname as Bats in the early era\n\nThe Bear - good but I think I want to rewatch it as S1 wasn\u2019t fresh in my head",

Truly stupid decisions, bafflingly lazy writing. You have 4+ hours per season to tell your hijacking story and you go the lamest, most generic routes. I cannot continue with this show, I'm done.\n\nWhat a wasted opportunity. So much more room with a series about a hijacking to explore things a typical hijack movie doesn't have time for. But they *still* go the cheapest, dumbest, most pointlessly bland route. Pathetic!",

So far so good for this new season in my eyes! I\u2019m fine with Liam Hemsworth as an actor but it will still be a big blow to this series to lose Cavill.

Lots of frantic energy, some likeable performances, but I\u2019m not sure how long they can go with this premise. Everyone on this shown needs to chill out, it\u2019s not that hard to make a tasty sandwich. \n\nKeeping up with **Platonic**, it\u2019s fine. Rose Byrne is funny, the story is pretty bland. Typically padded out streaming show that has a stretched out, hang out vibe - could have easily been six episodes and out.  \n\nBinged all three seasons of **Happy Valley**, solid British crime show with an atypical lead and down to earth stories. Third season is definitely a departure, with more cop show cliches. Overall enjoyed it, although watching the characters make such stupid decisions got a bit old. Solid performances.",
