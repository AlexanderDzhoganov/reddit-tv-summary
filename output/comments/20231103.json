One thing I like about the show is seeing returning contestants, but I don't know if the show took a nosedive in quality the past several years.\n\nAs far as the HBO shows, they are all great. Perhaps *Succession* is the most consitent in quality, but it can be the hardest to intially get into. It takes several episodes for you to warm up to the characters, because they aren't really likable people, but they are fascinating to watch.\n\nS1 of *True Detective* is by far my #1 favorite (although I think all three seasons are still worth watching, even the polarizing second season).\n\n*Leftovers* is great.  If you enjoy it, I'd also recommend watching Damon Lindelof 's other HBO project, *Watchmen* (you don't need to have read the comics, although Alan Moore's Watchmen graphic novel is a classic and a masterpiece, IMO).",

Apparently he and his wife created this series inspired by their mixed-race child, and it rocks extremely hard. Definitely not a show for kids though.",

I was hooked and binge-watched it all within a week. I'm so glad the show got renewed.\n\nIt's weird, though. I think *The Boys* might be the better show, because it's way more crazy, but I think I may prefer watching *Gen V* more, because it showed a bit more restraint in terms of shock value (although there is still plenty of it).  *Gen V*'s characters are also a bit more sympathetic and likable, so the show has a better balance for me.\n\nI wonder if Amazon had planned to originally release S4 of *The Boys* fairly soon after the end of *Gen V*, which would have made the cliffhanger ending more palatable. You see how it connects with S4 of *The Boys*, but the WGA strike has delayed the release of S4, even though I read they had wrapped up filming before the strike.\n\n**Lessons in Chemistry S1 EP5 (Apple TV)** \\-- I'm still really enjoying this show and Brie Larson is doing as fantastic job as Elizabeth, the quirky genius chemist and cook. Nice to finally see the development of Elizabeth's chemistry-based cooking show. I also really like the child actor playing Elizabeth's super smart daughter. We get to see more of her and her reaction to her mother's rising fame.\n\n**Bosch Legacy S2 EP1 (Amazon Prime)** \\-- I'm just happy there still more Bosch. While it seems the budget for this spinoff series is really minimal, with a much smaller cast and less locations, I still enjoy it.  The pacing for the spinoff series seems faster, than compared to the slow burn of the main *Bosch* series. The season two opener of *Bosch Legacy* wasted no time in picking up after the S1 cliffhanger.",

I thought the penultimate episode was much stronger than the finale. I\u2019m still excited to see how it builds into the larger Boys universe. It\u2019s strong enough that I\u2019d recommend it to any fan of super hero shows and I also think it\u2019s strong enough that having missed out on the Boys itself doesn\u2019t matter. In my opinion it\u2019s much more accessible than the boys and that\u2019s only because the brutality of the boys legitimately gave me nightmares. There is no equivalent villain that matches Homelander\u2019s terrifying presence, but the characters are all very relatable and that\u2019s what makes it accessible.",

The ending is a tad messy and rushed, but since the whole is firmly connected to the main series with actual appearances of some of its characters,  makes it all more valuable than if it had stayed as a in-universe with only references, like most Marvel shows do.  So, if you liked The Boys, this one is a no-brainer.\n\nBlue Eyes Samurai - 9 out of 10.  This animated adult series carried way heavier content than what it initially hinted at.  The animation in the fights is pretty good, but it\u2019s more commendable for its characters and story, with a driven anti-hero in the main role, and Akemi, a secondary character that undergoes a significant story arc trajectory of her own.  The main character makes mistakes and is rough around the edges, with a tragic past haunting their every move.  I hope a second season is greenlit as the story is not quite finished.  Oh, it also taught me a couple of new things about feudal Japanese culture.",

Logan... and Alien Covenant ..so yea fan of the work.\n\nThe art and animation is insane. Top tier.  Lot of anime and animated titles recently released.. but the art here is just amazing.. feels like quality you'd more expect from a big screen theatrical release.. reminds me of studio ghibli in a sense its a style youve seen before but this is perfected.\n\nIf you like this and other over the top gritty action like Warrior..Kill Bill..into the badlands etc.\n\nId definitely recommend Afro Samurai..heavily slept on / under appreciated as far as anime.. \n\nit came out in 2009.. right before anime culture entered the mainstream in the US. Has Samuel l jackson.. lucy lui..mark hamil..ron pearlman.. Tarantino was invovled to some extent.. RZA did the score. And the music and art together are elite.  The characters ..especially the villains are great...won a primetime emmy for its art. \n\neven with that and all the ppl attached to it.. still flies under the radar. \nIt has 1 season that is 5 episodes.. and a film that finishes the story.\n\nBut yea if you like one you will enjoy the other.",

No single performer stands out - they all elevate each other.  This is a great, creepy, slow burn from the same people who brought you **Haunting of Hill House** and the **Haunting of Bly Manor**.  I especially want to point out the exceptional soundtrack to this season.  The Newton Brothers have composed for Flanagan before, so if you've watched Hill House or Bly Manor you've heard their work.  The inclusion of one song in Usher really made me pay more attention to the soundtrack of this series.\n\nNo spoilers:  In this scene, Roderick and Madeline Usher enter a bar on New Years Eve 1979 and \"Back in the New York Groove\" by Ace Frehley is playing.  Ace Frehley, if you don't recognize the name is arguably the most unremarkable member of Kiss. This song has a quintessential disco sound but it lacks a lot of the energy and verve of most successful disco songs.  It's almost danceable.  You could almost dance to it, or you could go to the bar - either way - forgettable.  The Ushers in this scene are also unremarkable.  The bar isn't remarkable.  The Ushers aren't anyone of consequence (yet).  They exist.  They belong there, but there's just something off about them which makes the inclusion of that song in that setting perfect.  \n\nNow, technically Usher is horror so Halloween is the perfect time to watch it.  But with Thanksgiving bringing with it a large, weird extended family, none of whom like each other very much most of the time, November also seems like a great time to spend time with a demented and scary family that will (thankfully) just go away when you turn off the television.",

The Final Destination style deaths were entertaining but more importantly he did a good job keeping me interested in finding out just why this was happening to this family.\n\n**Billions**: Caught up on the last few episodes. The series ending wasn't too bad. A lot of great actors and acting in this series though it never felt like the whole was equal to the sum of its parts. Might have felt lke a tighter story if it had ended a couple seasons sooner.\n\n**Haunting of Hill House**: Before this week the only Netflix Flanagan stuff I'd watched was Bly Manor which for me was second only to this one. I enjoyed Hill House quite a lot. It's easily my favorite of the bunch. What he did with the story was great.\n\n**Midnight Mass**: My least favorite of the Netflix Flanagan series I have watched so far. Not bad by any means but just not the strongest showing. The pacing was off and the story felt a little loose.\n\n**Mr. Inbetween**: I binged this show based on a recommendation I saw in last week's thread and I wasn't disappointed. While a show led by a sympathetic anti-hero is nothing new, I feel like this show allowed you to actually see the true damage these kinds of characters bring to the world and those around them. Really well done show.\n\n**Elite**: I only watched episodes 1 & 2 of this Spanish teen drama and I'm not sure if I'll continue. It's been in my Netflix queue for years and after seeing ads for the new season I decided to finally give it a shot. The story just felt flat for me and I kept waiting to get hooked and never did. If there is anyone out there that watched and enjoyed this let me know if I should stick with it or not.\n\n**Weekly Shows**:\n\n**Rick & Morty**, **Upload**, **Bob's Burgers**, **Lower Decks**, **Gen V**, **Loki**, **The Challenge**: I enjoyed this week's episodes for all of these shows\n\n**Saturday Night Live**: Nate Bargatze was a truly funny host and I enjoyed most of the sketches this week.\n\n**Formula 1**: The Mexico Grand Prix had some strong moments. Perez >!flaming out in the opening lap!< and Lando's >!charge to the podium!< was exciting to see.\n\n**Big Brother US and UK**: Honestly I've lost a lot of my interest in watching BB US at this point. Nothing to do with the current season but the online fandom makes enjoying it difficult. BB UK, however, is having quite a good season and while I'm slightly behind on the episodes I've been enjoying the revival season.",

A part of me loves that it\u2019s a complete story and another part of me desperately wishes it had more seasons. 3 seasons makes it so easy to rewatch and dissect. One, the casting is PERFECT. Lots of lesser known types who put layers in like rich lasagna. Two, this is the only show that feels like it has two scripts: what the characters say, and what they really *mean*. Their biggest known actor (spoiler for this sentence) also goes the way of the lead of Game of Thrones. They trusted their artistic direction. It\u2019s the only espionage show I watched more than once, and I\u2019m a decent fan of the genre (burn notice, Alias, nikita for example). \n\nI love the story of the isolated, super human, unsuspecting girl with trust issues who understands everything and nothing, spotting danger in the subtle squints, nods, and smirks of her enemies. She\u2019s so incredibly, understatedly confident yet out of touch with what her identity would be if she ever knew peace. While it doesn\u2019t have humor, it has such a quiet warmth in the moments when Hanna feels just secure enough to let her guard down. The only flaw in the show for me is trying to convince everyone that the slow burn always pays off in rewards and that it takes a lot of attention to spot all the subtleties of its performances. I never see praise for this show but it sucks me in so deeply every time I come back to it.",

The attention to detail to Japanese feudal culture is really good. \n\nI also watched it again with the Japanese dub, and it's well done in Japanese too. I'm conflicted (but in a good way), as I like the original English voice acting as well the Japanese one, so I'm not sure which language I'll listen to. Maybe I just watch the whole thing twice, changling languages. \n\nThe Japanese audio and Japanese subtitles do add a little some more detail though, compared to the original English version, since they  can explicity use the appropriate Japanese feudal terminology. \n\nLike the feudal versions of courier / foot messenger is \u98db\u811a (hikyaku) and pimp \u5973\u8852 (gezen). It kind of hard to get that aspect across in English. They just called the feudal-style pimp dude as \"flesh trader\" in the English version.

It's complicated and it suckers you into watching it thinking it's just another horror/fantasy series about zombie-like creatures that terrorize humanity when it's so very much more than what you first sign up for.

It looks so expensive and it will never get the viewership it deserves but it's easily the best thing I've seen on Netflix in years.

I've read the comic in it's entirety and although the show is better due to it's changes (the comic hasn't aged well in my opinion and the show knows it) outside of the comic violence there isn't really anything that grabs my attention.

Even though I hadn\u2019t read the book, it still felt like a movie adaptation of a book which always feels like Cliffs Notes versions. It\u2019s a shame because shows like Sharp Objects have proven that book adaptations can be done really well in an extended series format. I think if they had extended it to 8+ episodes, it could have been really great. I also think that with as many excellent international & multilingual shows that have been released recently, there was a missed opportunity there. It was fine having everyone speak English but, for instance, having the German actors speak German to each other would have just added another layer to the immersiveness. I thought the sets & cinematography was well done. (Compared to Bodies where all their scenes in the past just looked and felt like cheap sets.) I like Mark Ruffalo and he was fine, but I don\u2019t think he was the best choice. The main character, Marie - I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on what bothered me about her but I think it was that I was never entirely sure how old she was supposed to be. She looked late 20s but acted like a naive child, so that was causing me some disconnect. There were some scenes with rom-com/fairy tale-like music that took me out of the moment.\n\nDespite all these complaints, I do think it was a good show. I just think it really had the potential to be incredible, so that feels like a shame. It\u2019s definitely worth a watch especially since it is only 4 episodes. If anything, watch it for Hugh Laurie & Louis Hofmann because they are always incredible. And I really hope this is the start of seeing Louis Hofmann in more productions.

I just don't think overall plot of season one is that good.\n\nI was committed to finishing this season of **The Witcher**, even if it meant suffering through another bad season. And suffer I did. It seemed like book readers actually liked some of the stuff from season three but I found it an absolute slog to get through. There were some good moments, but overall the writing was kind of a mess and I really did not get invested in a majority of the plotlines. It's hard to imagine I come back for season four.\n\nAs a side note, it feels like an eternity since **Invincible** premiered and I forgot how much I loved it and already binge re-watched the first season.

Tried it, it's alright in the first couple of episodes. \n\nBut the episode 5 which seems to receive gushing praise is terribly edited. The switching between past and present completely undercuts any tension. Makes the whole thing feel like a chore. Rolled my eyes so many times.\n\nSorry but this is a cheap Kill Bill knock off.\n\nEdit: To think people are comparing this to Pluto and Pantheon. This was a terrible waste of my time. Full of cliches and cardboard cutout characters.",

Yes, and you were the lead scientist, and also we were lovers, the very same Bronethium it is, your memory is correct. Anyways, have a good one",

It's got cool world building and I think some really enjoyable characters (*especially* the Crows team).\n\nMy only complaint? The show is overly dark visually. My TV is set up well and I've pretty much never had an issue with any other movie or show besides maybe one or two and I've had this TV for four years. And yet despite turning UP the active full array to brighten it a bit and watching in a fully dark room (I often watch with the lights on otherwise) there are still scenes where it's hard to make things out.",

Didnt like the season that focused on nile's daughter but the other 3seasons are a solid fun watch.    \n\nLoki finale was great, lot of great performances and I enjoyed the timetravel season.",
