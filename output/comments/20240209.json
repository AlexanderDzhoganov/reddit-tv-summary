Really enjoying the mystery and setting. \n\n**Hannibal** - Very late to the party but tried watching when it first came out but only made it a couple episodes.  Needed something and so gave it a shot now. Getting near the end of S2 now.  Such a high quality show with great actors.  Visually insane. Have to suspend belief in most of it but a great watch. \n\n**Tokyo Vice S2** - Good show. Looks like ol\u2019 Jake-San is going to get himself into some trouble. \n\n**Criminal Record** - Show is definitely carried by the two leads and interested to see how it\u2019s all tied up in the end.",

Better than I expected. The actors were pretty good, especially Fagin and Captain Gaines. The story was interesting.  8/10\n\n**The Fall of the House of Usher**  I enjoyed the various deaths and the different time periods. Got a bit monologue-y towards the end but nowhere near Midnight Mass levels. Another 8/10\n\n**Alice in Borderland season 2** Mixed feelings and watched it slowly, not binged. Some of it was fantastic, I loved the prison / Jack of Hearts section, I also really liked the maths with sulfuric acid / King of Diamonds sections. However, the games Arisu was involved in were far weaker. The container game/section just dragged on too long with too much discussion about the meaning of life. The tag game was just uninteresting and fairly boring action.\n\nThe main disappointment was the ending. The final game was just dull. The >!explanation for why the Borderland happened!< did fit the themes of the show and dialogue but as an explanation was just very unsatisfying for me. If you've got no interest in watching the show the explanation for >!why the events happened!< was that >!a meteor struck an area of Tokyo and the Borderland+games were some sort of collective illusion of people struggling to survive and whether they had any anything worth living for in the real world. Those that died in the Borderland died in real life from their meteor related injuries, those who survived to the end survived in real life!<.  Trying to be reflective for a second - maybe after two seasons of mystery no explanation the writers could come up with would've satisfied me but this specific ending was disappointing.  7.5/10\n\nGave up after one episode **All the Light We Cannot See** Just found it boring and Mark Ruffalo's accent was ridiculous.

The tie to Season 1 restricts it. \n >!a weird ancient killer microbe would be cool!<\nIt has meandered with too much family drama and whiney characters with the main plot neglected. Too many plates being spun. \n\n- Cobra Kai season 4 . Great spinoff, light with a few bad actors. Light hearted comedy drama with some good development from the movies. \n\n- Metallic Rouge . Has been slammed by many but I like it reminds me of 90s sci-fi anime series and clearly heavily inspired by Ghost in a Shell and Bladerunner.",

It's more like a slightly macabre 19th Century detective series - and starring Sean Bean at that. Mary Shelley is a character in it, and her book itself is part of the plot, but there's no reanimated corpses shuffling slowly up behind Sharpe looking to eat his braaaainz. Instead, it's Sean Bean as a gritty Northern copper in Georgian London - what's not to like?!\n\nIt's carrying a healthy 7.2/10 user rating on IMDB, yet I don't recall ever seeing anyone recommend it or talk about it online. It certainly went under the radar for me, but as far as I'm concerned it's been a bit of a hidden gem so far.\n\nI'm just getting to the end of season one (of two), and it's been marked by strong performances from the whole ensemble, great set and costumes, good pacing, and convincing dialogue. It's not aiming for total authenticity, but it's enough to suspend your disbelief. Encouragingly, the episode by episode ratings on IMDB suggest there's no drop off in quality in season two.\n\nEdit: Bloody hell, one of my only criticisms is that the plot seemed a little predictable.

This feels like it should have been a 3-4 hr show but was stretched to 6 hrs.\n\n**Masters of the Air Ep 4** - Still pretty decent.  Biggest problem is the inevitable comparison to its predecessors, and it can't really compete in part because the situations are different for the characters.  Huge plot twist happened completely offscreen so I suspect it's not as they have presented it.\n\n**Monarch: Legacy of Monsters Ep10** - Pretty good finale.  Entire season was good but I am glad I waited to binge it since the story detours would have been frustrating.\n\n**Babylon Berlin S4 Ep 1-6 (of 12)** - Mad that Netflix never picked this up and I finally had to resort to other means.  Still a fantastic show and I get totally engrossed into its world.  If I was a billionaire I'd spend my money funding more seasons of this show.  It does have a problem with too many storylines and so not enough time spent on the main characters.  I would have taken out most/all of the Nyssen storyline stuff from the past couple of seasons just to give the main characters more time.\n\nOnce I get past Babylon Berlin I'll probably pick up another Apple show since I still have most of them to watch.

            "body": "***Resident Alien S3*** (Syfy, Peacock) is back and it still continues to make me happy. Gray aliens and Linda Hamilton. What more could we want?\n\n[***Tracker***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMVD9oenbs) (CBS/Paramount+). I'm there primarily because a shirtless Justin Hartley does it for me :), and I still remember him as the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen on *Smallville.* Not sure this show is going to keep me watching, but the premise is kind of fun as a tracker/survivalist earns a living as a \"rewardist\". Silly broadcast fun. I'll see if it sticks in the rotation.\n\n***Wild Cards*** (CW). Yeah, I was really bored. It's mildly entertaining. A Canadian CTV import with a similar premise to *White Collar,* but with leads that aren't as charismatic and writing that's duller. If I had less stuff on the plate it might stay in the rotation, but no room for this one now.\n\n***Mr. and Mrs. Smith*** (Amazon Prime). Didn't love this as much as everyone else, although I did enjoy it and I did watch the whole thing. I'm just someone who gets turned off by the self-indulgence that tends to be on display with heavily improvised works (only exception is Altman. And this is not Altman). Having two characters discussing farting in bed together for five minutes, to me, isn't as entertaining as it thinks it is, but if the faux-realistic vibe works for you, more power to ya.\n\n***Genius: MLK/X*** (FX/Hulu). Noped out after half an hour. Not sure why, since the subject's fascinating and I've loved the previous three seasons of *Genius* (though we're now hell and gone from Albert Einstein). But I just couldn't get into it. Dropped.\n\n***Feud: Capote vs. the Swans*** (FX/Hulu) continues to be one of my favorites each week. It's definitely pandering to some of my worst instincts as a viewer as it's all about bitchiness :), but the sheer enthusiasm and verve with which a frankly amazing cast are attacking all their roles is a joy to watch. Tom Hollander's Capote is jaw-dropping.\n\n***All Creatures Great and Small S4*** (PBS *Masterpiece)* nears its finale with only the Christmas special to go. I shall miss my warm fuzzy teddy bear show. Hopefully Channel 5 will renew it. I'm just sad nobody at PBS thought to pick up the [*All Creatures Great and Small Meets the Yorkshire Vet*](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/all-creatures-yorkshire-vet-christmas-newsupdate/) Christmas special. :)\n\n***Way Home S2*** (Hallmark Channel/Peacock). Man, just as strong as S1, and they seem to be doubling down, adding 1814 as another time period for the time travellers to be hopping around in. Hallmark Channel was the last place I expected to be watching a solid time travel series.\n\n***Family Law S3*** (CW). Still enjoying the hell out of this Canadian (GlobalTV) legal family dramedy series. Loved the whole recent episode exchange of: \"Do we really think he was fired because he was gay? It's the 21st century.\" \"On that channel? Have you seen their movies? No queer characters, no characters of color...\"  \"No gay actors playing leading men...\" and every head swivels to the door as in walks Harry Svensson, the leading man of the series, played by Victor Garber. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso watching, but you probably don't care: *The Irrational, Quantum Leap, True Detective: Night Country,* and *Transplant.* Also did a but of cherry picking \"Elsbeth Tascioni\" episodes of *The Good Wife* on Amazon Prime in preparation for *Elsbeth*'s premiere on CBS.\n\nUpcoming for me:\n\n* 2/18. *Equalizer S4 / CSI: Vegas* (CBS). I'm not proud.\n* 2/20. *The Rookie S6 / The Good Doctor S7* (ABC). Ditto. Final season for *The Good Doctor.* On balance, the KDrama was way better.\n* 2/21. [*The Bad Batch S3*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa5zeHdSwdQ) (Disney+). Final season.\n* 2/22. [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByAn8DF8Ykk) (Netflix) 8x1hr. live action. Showrunner is [Albert Kim](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2609103/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).\n* 2/27. [*Sh\u014dgun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCkNlc8xSi4) (FX/Hulu)\n* 2/29. [*The Tourist* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFJjZUvAbDQ) (Netflix); the action's moved from Australia to Ireland.\n* 2/29. [*Elsbeth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J-fCrWcF14) (CBS). Robert & Michelle King (*Evil, The Good Wife, Braindead*) do a spinoff around Cary Preston's ADHD lawyer character, Elsbeth Tascioni, from *The Good Wife/The Good Fight.*\n* 3/3. [*The Regime*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82bST-tsEdY) (Max)\n* 3/6. *Extraordinary S2* (Hulu)\n* 3/7. [*The Gentlemen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnpfKsqeMrM) (Netflix) Guy Ritchie helps Matthew Reade make a streaming series variant on his movie premise.\n* 3/14. [*9-1-1* S7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss9eSFK2GAI) (ABC/Hulu). Note it's not on Fox any more. *Lone Star* (which still is on Fox) has been held until the fall.\n* 3/17. [*Nolly*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r424Snx--0) (PBS *Masterpiece*). Russell T. Davies period biodrama about the firing of Noele Gordon from *Crossroads.*\n* 3/18. [*Photographer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSCjIRdu1ZY) (NatGeo/Disney+/Hulu). Documentary.\n* 3/20. [*X-Men '97*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv3Ss8o9gGQ) (Disney+)\n* 3/21. [*3 Body Problem*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mogSbMD6EcY) (Netflix). The US Benioff/Wise one. Not the Chinese Tencent *Three Body* ([Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body/dp/B0B676WP3C)).\n* 3/28. [*Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQCLLwkfGWo) S2 (Britbox) BBC Jimmy McGovern seasonal anthology about people caught up in the prison system. This season instead of Sean Bean and Stephen Graham, it's Jodie Comer, Tamara Lawrence and Bella Ramsey.\n* 3/29. *A Gentleman in Moscow* (Showtime/Paramount+) Ewan McGregor stars as a Russian count who's confined to a hotel by the Russian Revolution. Showrunner is Ben Vanstone *(All Creatures Great and Small).*\n* 3/29. [***Renegade Nell***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax9zwy9wLHA) (Disney+). My most-anticipated show of 2024, because it's written by [Sally Wainwright](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906550/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) *(Happy Valley, Gentleman Jack, Last Tango in Halifax),* about a highwaywoman in 18th-century England and it's a fantasy/adventure series. Stars Louisa Harland  *(Derry Girls).*\n\n\\--edited to add:\n\nJust started ***Vigil S2***. No submarine. This time it's drones.  Pretty much at the level of S1. Probably not for you unless you're already that way inclined. Decent middling UK cop procedural with a military twist. Tom Edge is one of the *\\[C.B.*\\] *Strike* writers.",

It wouldn't make my best shows of the year list but the television landscape needs more fun shows like this.  \n\n**Three Pines** (Amazon). Another one cancelled but I won't really miss this show.  This was a Canadian police/detective show with Alfred Molina as the main detective.  Molina does a fine job as the lead but they just don't give him anything to work with and the show ended up incredibly boring IMO.  It made me realize how important it is to have a main character with some quirkiness or character, as just being a competent normal detective just makes the show a slog. \n\nI'm about halfway through **Loot** (Apple) and enjoying this far more than I expected.

            "body": "**The Bear Season 2** Hulu. Welp, I finally caved and binged Season 2. It was a very solid follow up from an exceptional Season 1 that was hard to follow. The clear love for food, family, and the sense of place make this a wonderful show. I enjoyed the two \"big hit\" episodes (Fishes and Forks) although my one nitpick is Ritchie goes from attitude problem cast out to Mr. Hero fave in less than a week? A bit of artistic license there I think. \nThere is a lot of back and forth on should Syd and Carmy be a couple since they have chemistry. Firstly, I question if Syd is even straight--there are hints to me that feel like she's coded as...not straight. But friend, mentor, and \"buddies in a foxhole\" chemistry is not romantic chemistry and I don't see romantic chemistry with those two. There's also a lot of talk about how \"annoying\" Syd is as a character which I find irritating when Fak and Ritchie are easily just as annoying, if not more (and should know better as full grown men!). Syd is a complex person, just like the other characters. I agree with people who dislike Claire as a plot device and find her \"too perfect\"--she was Cool Girl to the max and I was very taken out of the show with her lines and her whole thing. \n\n**Miss Americana** on Netflix. After the...questionable shall we say choices of one Miss T. Swift at the Grammys I went down a rabbit hole and finally watched this doc. It was a very flattering portrayal, of course, and I could clearly see the line from how she was acting in the doc to the Grammys. Taylor's always been rewarded for a puppy-like high energy Tigger vibe. Now that she's 34, it's a stale act, and she's coming off 6ish years of relative isolation including Covid, into a HUGE explosion of super-stardom. I think she doesn't realize her \"cute\" \"quirky girlie\" act isn't working anymore the way it did in her 20s. She specifically talks about fears of being discarded after 35 and how hard it is to keep finding new facets of her personality to share the journey and walk the line with her fans. I think *some* of what happened at the Grammys was a melting of that \"facet\" finding--like she may believe that a high energy, ultra-cheerleader football girlfriend wild-child Baby Girl is something the public wants/enjoys and is confused and hurt that it's not getting received in the same manner as Broken Hearted Girl, GirlBoss Girl, Singer-Songwriter Artist Girl, So in Love Girl, etc. I also think substances were involved as well, pretty clearly, but the doc is very revealing. For those who were introduced to her or re-introduced via chatter about the weird behavior at the Grammys, the doc might be a great place to get some context. \n\n**Expats** on Prime. Still a solid show, and let's face it: I will watch anything my Forever Princess Nicole is in. However, I have a sore spot of the to-me very shallow characterization of the crabby, bitchy nit-picking Career Woman who drives her husband away. He's a cheating prick!! I don't love the show's choice to have her call a waiter over and ask for a new glass of wine as a \"final straw\" for \"Poor David\" give me a break. Okay maybe her self-centered Type A attitude has been going on for years and he can't take it. But we need a fresh take on this very stale type, show. My heart also broke for the cute gal who I think asked Mercy on a date and got ditched. She likely thinks she got rejected even as a friend just for being gay/bi/queer sniffle!",

Batwoman S3 was just ok, the plot never topped its debut season and got very silly to handle all the cast shuffling. Then had a lot of fun with Gotham Knights S1, lowered expectations and the reality that likely there won\u2019t be a new Berlanti/Arrowverse style show ever freed me up to enjoy it for what it was. Most of the \u201cBrat Family\u201d really grew on me by the end of the season, it\u2019s one of the better No-Batman Batman shows. It\u2019s quite possible S&L will be the last WB / CW season I ever watch, quite a fun 24 year run, sad it\u2019s effectively over",
