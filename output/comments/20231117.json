I would travel to New York City to watch a Star Trek Broadway show, and this is the closest we'll get.

Strongly recommend. \n\n**Rap Shit** on HBO/Max. Again, HELLO I need to BINGE. I binged through the rest of Season 1 to prep for Season 2 because the Season 2 marketing is (IMHO deliberately) coy about \"watch Season 2 now!\" okay, what it doesn't say is \"watch the season opener now\"! I will pretty much watch any Issa Rae jawn and this is no exception. Funny, well done, interesting, the music slaps, and just so watchable. \n\n**Special Ops: Lioness** Paramount Plus finally finished! The show went in some annoyingly predictable directions that felt a little...objectifying shall we say? But my forever angel Nicole Kidman can do no wrong and she looks terrific in this-if a tad bit frozen around the mouth. I'm hoping to find more shows like this and got some great suggestions so I'll be tackling those next.\n\n**Scavenger's Reign** on HBO Max--wow, a masterpiece. Animated stuff isn't my usual jam, but this was so amazing I binged it all in one day.

It is anthology meaning each season has different characters and different stories so it does not matter if you just watch this season first then go back and watch the rest in any order you want but I would absolutely recommend Season 1. Most people do not like Season 4 but I like Season 4 better than 3. For me 3 is probably the worse of them all. \n2. Each season of the show has no connection with the movie plot wise. However the theme of all the series have many references to the movie and some other Coen brother movies. \n3. This is something that maybe some viewers who had watch do not know and many new viewers got fooled.  At the beginning of every episode, there is an opening sentence. \" This is based on a true story....etc..etc..\" Well none of the seasons are actually based on a a true story. It is a joke that was started by Coen brothers in the movie and continued by Noah Hawley (creator of the TV series). \n\nIf you like dark comedy with crime and violence, Fargo is your show.",

            "body": "I finished **Bodies** relatively quickly, and it was an interesting show. The hook of the show is a mystery surrounding a supernatural event (I won't specify whether that means magic/mysticism or science fiction) and I always like to know the creator's approach to that.\n\nI personally prefer the Jonathan Nolan or Brandon Sanderson style of fiction for magic or sci-fi where they establish a clear set of rules and then the narrative obediently stays within those limits. This show isn't *quite* that. I'd say it's more like The Peripheral or Tenet where they establish ground rules, they follow their own rules, but if you think about how the narrative uses those rules under too much scrutiny, then it doesn't really make sense.\n\nI'd say it's less a show focused solely on investigating something supernatural (which it does include), and more of a character-driven drama that is built around the supernatural premise. In the end I think this approach was appropriate for the story and it was good that the emotions and human element of the story were more important than everything making logical sense. Pretty much of all of the characters have tragic arcs where they get punished for having mostly good intentions.\n\nI know I'm just rambling at this point but overall I did enjoy the process of watching it. It's well-written and well-acted. The production quality is great. I was captivated from the first episode, and while I didn't have an insatiable hunger to binge the whole show, whenever I had free time, I wanted to watch the next episode. I worry that shows like this can stall at times, but I found the pacing pretty good and it never felt to me like there was an episode where no progress was made, however I also felt that there was no standout episode or any moment that surprised me. At the moment I am tempted to say it's an 8/10 for me, but I just don't see this show having any longevity. At best it's the kind of show where five years down the line someone says, \"Wow I never heard of this show but it was a hidden gem!\". So I'll say 7/10.",

So many good shows right now.\n\n**Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S1 EP1 & EP2 (AppleTV) -**\\- Grew up watching Japanese Godzilla and kaiju monster movies, so I'm enjoying the show even though it's not perfect. I like the fact they use actual Japanese actors for the Japanese roles since I can understand Japanese.  It's also kind of cool the show also tapped into the 80s action-movie vibe by casting Kurt Russell.   I also like how the show is making the narrative more interesting by shifting back and forth between two groups of people encountering the monsters in two different time periods -- the 1950s and 2015.\n\n**Blue Eye Samurai S1 (Netflix)** \\-- Finished this show and looking forward to season two. I had some criticisms with the last two episodes regarding some of the battle scenes at the castle were handled, but overall, I still really enjoyed it.\n\n**For All Mankind S4 EP2 (AppleTV)** \\-- I like this show the best when it focuses on the sci-fi elements and we see that here as we get a closer look at the Mars base, which is essentially like the beginnings of a small town.  I'm also really enjoying the new character Miles Dale.  I'm also a fan of Margo so I'm glad we'll see more of her.\n\n**Lessons in Chemistry S1 EP7 (AppleTV)** \\-- the penultimate episode before the finale and I'm sad it's almost over. Great episode that had me almost crying a few times as it goes over some of the past events by from a new perspective.  I'm really glad Apple TV has a bunch of wholesome uplifting shows, like this one, as well as Shrinking and Ted Lasso. Normally I like darker kind of shows but I'm finding shows like these to be a refreshing change of pace.\n\n**Bear S2 EP1 to Ep7 (Hulu)** \\-- I was skeptical that the second season would lose something of the magic of the first season because it had a bigger budget to play with so it could go to more locations. The first season had an addictive but exhausting claustrophobic quality since it was mainly set in a small kitchen.\n\nI was wrong. This season has been fantastic so far. I loved the way the show has used different locales, and even how it handled the guest roles of some really well-known actors.\n\nIt made me realize that this show, while it can be intense, is actually a rather uplifting show as it finds moments of peace and triumph for these struggling characters that live in a busy and chaotic world.   Episode four that was shot in Copenhagen, and episode seven called \"Forks\" really brought a smile to my face. I think I could rewatch these two episodes many times over.",

I\u2019ll be very sad to see it end. \n\n**A Murder At The End Of The World** has gotten off to a strong start!! Lots of intriguing mysteries so far. I love Darby and Bill\u2019s relationship. There\u2019s something about Bill that I am really into. \nI loved the OA, so I\u2019m confident this will be banger. \n\n**For All Mankind** So happy to be back in this alternate timeline. The start of the season montage with all the changes is always great. I really like what they are setting up with the class struggle on mars, I assume that will reflect the situation in the USSR. As a Canadian, the \u201cCanada declined to join the M7 Alliance to pursue their own interests in space\u201d was a hilarious and unexpected twist. \n\n**Monarch: Legacy of Monsters** I got, surprisingly, super invested in this after these 2 episodes lol. I had only seen Godzilla 2014 many years before watching this, but I remembered enjoying it. After finishing the 2 episodes, I immediately wanted to rewatch Godzilla 2014 and man, that movie is great. It\u2019s really so much better than it had any right to be. I\u2019m not a traditional \u201caction movie\u201d person (I DO love a good disaster movie though, so this scratches that itch)\u2026 Godzilla 2014 is everything I want from that genre. There\u2019s one particular scene where all these planes are falling out of the sky due to the MUTOs EMP that genuinely shook me. Like DAMN. There are so many great scenes. I really love this movie. I love that the giant lizard doesn\u2019t give a shit about humanity, it\u2019s not antagonistic towards humans at all. It\u2019s just here to protect its turf from these fuck\u2019n bugs and bounce. The city just happened to get in the way. \n\nSo, of course, like the reasonable person I am\u2026 I spent the evening binge watching the other 3 \u201cMonsterverse\u201d movies. None of them are as good as Godzilla 2014 imo. My \u2018objective\u2019 brain feels like they progressively got worse... But I enjoyed the heck out of them lol. They are certainly dumb fun and a total spectacle and I can\u2019t say I regret the time watching one bit. I do kinda wish they had kept up the tone of Godzilla 2014 throughout, but idk, maybe that would\u2019ve gotten old. By the end, I was genuinely giggling thinking how preposterous the plot was\u2026 but after a rough week, I needed that giggle. I am now a \u201cmonsterverse\u201d super fan. I will be watching this show, along with all the new instalments.",

Having traveled from South America, this man rubs his back and leans on a table. The CBP supervisor describes this as a key indicator of having rectal cocaine.\n\nHe actually does, but also has an opioid addiction. He is taken from the hospital and locked in a cell just as the withdrawal kicks in. Duty of care is not a concept known to the CBP supervisor who gloats at his suffering.\n\nNext up, a sniffer dog in NYC. He is a good boy.\n\nThen the sniffer dog in Miami. He gets upset that he doesn't always find things. He is a human. Instead of being happy that there were no drugs today, he is upset that the border of the USA is respected. Perhaps he also needs planted drugs to prevent depression like an actual sniffer dog.\n\nAlso in this segment, destroying goods from overseas, probing food with unsanitary tools in unsanitary conditions then saying it's \"good to go\".\n\nFinally, LAX, where the concept of savings is so alien to CBP that they investigate a man because he can afford holidays and expect to find printed CVs/resumes in bags to prove intent to work.\n\nThis show is a horror story for anyone living in or visiting the USA.

I grew up watching Japanese Godzilla and kaiju (big monster) movies and TV shows as a child so it was nice that the show tries to preserve the ties to its Japanese origins. It made me glad to hear authentic Japanese in the show.\n\nThey also nailed it with the bilingual Japanese speakers. I'm similar to Cate in the show and mainly used Japanese at home and often with only my father while I used English more with my mother.  Although I went through phases where I used English at exclusively at home during my \"rebellious\" teen years.  During this time, I'd also use English at Japanese restaurants, markets, bookstores, as long as I knew the Japanese person could understand me.\n\nBecause of that, I could relate to Cate's reluctance to use Japanese even with other Japanese speakers. Often, your heritage language has an emotional component that is tied to your identity, and it can also be a reminder of your parents.  In Cate's case, it was her special \"secret\" language to a father she thinks may be dead, or perhaps abandoned her.  It makes sense for her to not want to use it.\n\nUnfortunately, I've read some criticisms of Cate for not using Japanese right away in the show and that it just seemed like a lame plot device to hide her Japanese speaking ability from the audience, but I totally get where she's coming from.\n\nOn the flipside, why does her half-brother Ren speak such perfect English? I assume he was born and raised in Japan, but his English sounds really American-native-like, too good.\n\nI'm guessing maybe his father Hiroshi spoke to him English, while he did the reverse with Cate? \n\n We haven't heard Hiroshi speak English yet in the show (was he in the Godzilla 2014 movie? I forget) but if he's the son of Dr. Keiko Miura, who seems to be Japanese-American, then it makes sense he would be a native English speaker just like his mother, and that might explain why his son Ren's Engish is so good too.",

I really like that it doesn't follow the YA/Teens save the world. Coming from watching Invasion, Foundation, and now The Monarch, I'm long overdue for some adults in a show. Maybe it has to do with being middle aged? First 2 seasons were a bit slow. About to begin S3. \n\nI saw that Six Feet Under is on Netflix. I'd tried to watch it a number of years ago when I Had HBO but can't remember how far I got or why I didn't finish it. Might give it a go before it's gone from Netflix. Another show I wanted to check out was Mad Men but I blinked when Netflix had it and now it's gone. Same case with Dexter. \n\nSo far am holding out until all of Invincible is out to binge.

I haven't watched any of the MCU stuff except for that of the X-Men franchise and the first Avengers movie. Therefore my expectations of a superhero series produced by Marvel were completely different from what was in Legion.\n\n**Captain Fall**: Not going to lie this is probably one of the driest shows I have seen so far. The only positive is that Jonathan Fall's character has more depth in the last few episodes.

Paul, Julia, Judith, and Avis all end up in Paris together by episode 3. My favorite scene so far is the one with Judith, as an editor conferring with one of her authors, \"JP,\" and then introducing him to Avis, >!given that JP's last name is Sartre. Existentialist hilarity ensues :D !<.\n\nMax dropped the first three episodes of the season all at once.  I will also add the \"Dishing on Julia\" (official HBO) podcast is cherce, and the show is about quite a bit more than just Julia Child and cooking as they've got the '60s and Public Television as their twin playgrounds. They've also added Rachel Bloom to the cast (she's playing the new director of *The French Chef* since Russ has left to do his magazine news programme) as well as Stockard Channing.\n\nI also love the fact that the showrunner is Chris Keyser, who was the most visible spokesperson for the WGA during the strikes as one of the negotiating committee.

Nothing worthwhile came from watching his arc.\n\nAlso, I didn't really dislike Chris all that much despite the series making her out to be this evil person. She was way more patient with that dumbass Barry than I would be and she even saved him too. Out of all the characters I think only Sam had a satisfying ending to their story.\n\nVisually a stunning series.

I will say that I think Mike Flanagan totally suceeded in what he was trying to do: updating Edgar Allen Poe and his Victorian style, with bold reliigous-style moral scolding and unsubtle social satire, all drenched in gothic themes, to 2023. I, personally, however am not interested in characters monologing to audience surrogates about social issues for literally whole episode lengths, and also a very strange narrative framing structure which gives away the entire story of the show in the first couple of episodes, leaving the viewer to watch a series of unpleasant and gruesome scenes (some quite well done, admittedly) wherein you just wait the entire episode length for characters to be tortured and killed that you know, well, were going to be tortured and killed from the moment the episode started.\n\nGiven the ratings, a lot of people found this show compelling, but to me it was a huge disappointment after the really interesting, scary, and subtle Midnight Mass. Not scary, not an interesting story, not insightful social commentary, and yet another streaming sf/horror/thriller show that promises much and delivers little. I've actually been annoyed for days that I let the sunk cost of this show keep me watching until the on, hoping for some kind of interesting payoff long past the point of enjoyment or actual interest. Sensing that **Bodies (Netflix)** was going to be something similar, I stopped watching shortly after starting it.\n\nFor me, there could have been a great hallucinatory and scary reality-bending show here, where a corporate scion descends into illness/madness/delusion/haunting with heavy emphasis on not only his personal past but really delving more into the Egyptology themes that were backgrounded in the actual show. Alas, I don't think those are the kind of shows Mike Flanagan wants to make, and that's fine, but I don't think I'm going to follow him, or this genre, in the future.",

And Ray\u2019s pre-AI self was involved. \n\nWhy was that important? Because there is no episode 3. It auto played a different show, which had a kid named Billy. This cult changed people\u2019s names. The person I thought was Ray looked like him but was named Bryce. So it just all made sense names were different. And it was going to somehow end up being Anderson somehow killed Ray and put him into his technology to remember him. And bill\u2019s mom was part of this whole plot somehow. \n\nTldr; auto played murder at the end of the world into a show called the clearing thinking it was a flashback episode 3 to bills childhood.",
