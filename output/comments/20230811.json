It ended in 2019. \n\nIt has been so painful waiting for everyone to catch up and watch Mr. Robot. \n\nThere were things about the show that were oddly prophetic, but nobody realizes it when they binge it now. Like Ashley Madison. The hack hadn\u2019t happened when the show premiered. Rami and Christian and others thought it was a woman\u2019s name. (Elliot uses it to blackmail Lenny.) The hack actually happened a little bit after that aired. No one knew what it was at the time, though. \n\n>!Then, the season 1 premier was held for a week, bc the day it was supposed to air, a reporter and her camera man were shot and killed on air. Since the episode has the on air suicide, they delayed showing it for a week. That was eerie as fuck.!<\n\nAnd then the way society breaks down? Alllllll of that aired before the pandemic. When COVID hit, it all felt eerily similar. There\u2019s even a scene where the rabbi is wearing a mask. I was rewatching and realized that the just seemed normal to me bc of the pandemic. \n\nYou have an amazing journey still ahead of you. I\u2019m so jealous. \n\nI\u2019m so glad people are jumping on the show, though. It\u2019s a masterpiece. You haven\u2019t seen it all until you\u2019ve watched it twice. It\u2019s so well crafted. Sam Emsail knew the end before they started. He also wrote, directed and edited all of seasons 2-4. \n\nEveryone should watch it before all of the \u201cSnape kills Dumbledore\u201d moments make it into the mainstream. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of great tv, but Mr. Robot changed me as a person. (That makes me sound like a psycho for about 3 1/3 seasons, but it all makes sense in the end.)\n\nEnjoy it all. It\u2019ll be over before you know it. Make sure you pick up the [book that accompanies S2,](https://www.amazon.com/MR-ROBOT-Red-Wheelbarrow-eps1-91_redwheelbarr0w-txt/dp/1419724428) and check out [the short film.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1DcKBwliAw)\n\nSam didn\u2019t miss a detail. The show is just fantastic.",

I have to say, the idea of making Meryl Streep play an awful actress was quite inspired. It's like the ultimate challenge for her I guess.\n\nI'm also digging **Captain Fall**. Ok, sometimes it's too savage or too frivolous or just too dark for my taste (like when they make child soldiers the butt of the joke), but it's a clever show, and it's got a proper narrative arc and all.",

I really don't think this show works as a \"serious show\".\n\nThe homages were awesome, the music selection was absolutely perfect (nostalgia for 90's and early 2000's kids even though I think they're saving Rob Zombie for a green lit Season 2), I loved how many of the characters from the game they included. I was really surprised how well the writing and dialogue was too. \n\nAnthony Mackie I thought killed it as the lead role as John Doe (the Milk Man) ... I really loved how they made him whimsical and lighter, yet still serious and emotional invest worthy, as opposed to some corny badass protagonist.\n\nSweet Tooth (Needles Kane) to me was the glue to the show and Will Arnett voicing him was perfect with Somoa Joe nailing the body double. I loved every moment he was on screen and how they designed his character to be a psychopathic murderer one moment and kind or relatable somewhat and rooting for him another moment. It made him so much more unpredictable. \n\nThey set the entire thing up perfectly for an awesome Season 2 and I'm really hoping this writers strike doesn't keep it from getting made.",

What a beautiful, hopeful ending to that episode. I loved those two scientists.\n\n I can really only hope James Gunn can bring this kind of energy to a Superman movie.",

The last episode was great, and season 3 as a whole has started very strong.\n* **Justified City Primeval:** This has taken a back seat for us a little bit; we're a few episodes behind but looking to catch up.\n* **Physical:**  This show can be so cringe at times; the last episode was no exception.  I'm missing a couple of the characters from the first few seasons.  Zooey Deschanel has been great so far, though.\n\n*Finished*\n\n* **The Righteous Gemstones:** This show was so dumb and so fun in every way possible.  Such an easy watch.\n* **Black Mirror:**  It's like they got rid of the technology aspect and went to straight horror for the majority of the episodes.  Which, was fine, I guess, but not the first thing I think of when I think of classic Black Mirror.\n* **Secret Invasion:**  Marvel needs to get their act together.\n* **Quarterback:** If you're an NFL fan, this is like Hard Knocks, but for an entire season and for specific player(s).\n\n*On Deck*\n\n* **Ahsoka:**  Aside from Andor, the recent Star Wars content, for me anyway, has been meh at best.

I enjoyed the series, kept me hooked. Though, felt the cliffhanger was unnecessary and just an attempt at trying to get a 2nd season renewal.\n\nAlso finished: **Fifteen Love** a 6 part British series on Prime Video about a 17-year old tennis prodigy who makes it to the final of the French Open but fails to win after a wrist injury. 5 years later, as an adult she comes forward with a claim of assault against her tennis coach. The show then kind of develops into a cat and mouse thriller. I thought it was decent, not amazing TV, but a good quick short binge.

Good TV up until you think about what it is actually telling the audience - the same question raised while producing Meg. The veneer of progressive politics falls apart as it's not aspirational as it wants to be. But it is self-aware enough to call itself out while referencing The Song of the South. Instead of slaves, it's young people being conditioned to accept the depravity in their quest for fame and fortune. It serves fantasy & Tarantino flavoured revisionism.

            "body": "**Walking Dead: Dead City**\n\nThis ended up being much better than I expected.  The writers did a great job writing the the Negan/Maggie dynamic, with the actors giving some of their better performances in years IMO.  It helps that it was very specifically written around their characters, rather than sharing their time with a bunch of other characters.  The supporting characters that they *do* have were pretty good, but are mostly used to serve the main arc.  And the villain was good as well.  Zeljko Ivanek was a great choice, making his character wonderfully unhinged, and acting as a great foil for Negan's character.  I thought the ending was pretty good as it is, although since it looks like the scope is going to be bigger in season 2, I'm hoping it won't fall back into some of the franchise's bigger issues.\n\n**Superman The Animated Series season 2**\n\nAs a whole, I'd say this season was better than season 1, even if it was a bit more uneven at times.  Being double the number of episodes let them push things a bit more, and it had a good number of stand-alone episodes, recurring villains, and also started to push things into the bigger DC universe with some guest superheroes.  And this season did have a few episodes that were easily my favorites of the season so far: \"World's Finest\" (3-parter), \"The Late Mr. Kent,\" and \"Apokolips... Now.\"\n\n**MASH season 5**\n\nFor a while, I've grouped this in with seasons 4-7 as my favorite era of the series.  However, while I still enjoy it (as I do with every season), this season was the most weakened by my rewatch.  A big part of that is because of Frank's Flanderization, which started in season 4, but got even worse here.  It also doesn't help that I feel like this is also Margaret's weakest season because of how much she becomes obsessed with her husband.  Though to be fair, they each had their moments, and the actors played them as well as could be.  However, in some ways it does continue the strong writing built up through the earlier seasons, with some really good episodes throughout.\n\n**Jack Ryan season 4**\n\nNot the strongest season of the show.  I did think some of the ideas were good, with the whole conspiracy angle, but I think it was a bit too much to take on, especially for a 6 episode season, becoming a bit rushed and convoluted.\n\n**Outlander season 6**\n\nI'm a bit mixed on this season.  There were some things I really liked, but some which I didn't really care for.  Of the two antagonists, I thought they did a really good job with Tom Christie.  More than I thought they would.  On the other hand, the stuff with >!Malva!< wasn't the best.  I did like the stuff with Ian, particularly dealing with his past.  Overall though, this season felt a bit more like a transition leading into a bigger story next season.\n\n**Manifest season 4**\n\nOuch.  When I first got into this series, shortly after Netflix picked it up after its cancellation, I actually liked it.  I wouldn't have put it among my favorite shows, but I thought it has a pretty interesting story.  But things really fell apart as it went along IMO, especially in the latter half of this series.  TBH, I don't think that the religious angle is inherently bad, but can be tricky to pull off right, and I don't think really do it well here.  But what's worse for me was Angelina.  I don't really mind her too much at first, but she got so much worse as time went on.  And the whole finale may be one of my least favorites in a while.  >!Honestly, I can't help thinking that the trial they went through to prove themselves is similar to stuff like The Stand and Lost, both of which I think did a much better job with it, even if not everyone cared for the latter.!<.",

It treaded some really dark places, and the last episode was both disturbing and heartbreaking to say the least. I liked the running theme of how we never really know what goes on inside someone else\u2019s heart, as Alec Hardy (played by Tennant) puts it, including those closest to us who we think we know well.     \n\nBut the best part of the show for me was the (platonic) chemistry between Tennant\u2019s and Colman\u2019s characters. Their banter was fun, and it was bittersweet how in the last episode >!Alec stood up for Ellie and supported her when she was at her lowest, but no one had done that for him when he had gone through something similar, and he had to take the fall and deal with its aftermath all by himself at the expense of his reputation, career, and health.!<     \n\nThe only thing that\u2019s bothering me is >!the character of the psychic!< because I\u2019m not quite sure what that guy\u2019s purpose was? >!Alec approaching him in his desperation because he was running out of time after having previously berated him as a conman and a nutjob (and understandably so)!< threw me in for a loop because what was the show trying to tell us here? That the guy was legit and deserves our sympathy? Was it deliberately left ambiguous?        \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m looking forward to picking up the second season soon and hoping it explores more of Alec\u2019s past.",

From season one we get the charming good vibes and cool super natural stories.  Quirky characters and surprisingly heavy issues. The show is just really solid.  Some of the episodes are too emotional however and take a certain mood to enjoy them.  Really liking this show, glad I started watching it.\n\n**Game of Thrones**\nI've been rewatching this bad boy from the beginning and man, it was so god damn good lol.  Watching it casually because I needed a show to throw on in the background while I play BG3 and work.  Seriously just perfect TV for the first five or so seasons.  It's weird having hope for the good guys in the beginning because they are doing everything right, but we all know what happens.

And I did enjoy some of the relationship drama mixing it up for the characters, even tho the endings I think could have been handled a bit better. But I think it's really clear by the end it's primarily a transitionary season for everyone's arcs, so if the show gets renewed and ends in a S3 or S4 (like it should imo before it has a chance to fuck up its style) this season will be much better in retrospect. \n\nI don't know if I would be happy if they go into a Atlanta/master of none/ramy experimental comedy kinda thing like they kinda toed with for a few eps this season. They should be creative but I hope they don't forget what made the show so strong to begin with, the chemistry w the cast and the dialogue. If we get a ton of solo episodes of characters having mini arcs that is going to suck honestly esp in these 8 episode 20 min seasons. \n\nIs there a name for that kinda show btw lol, why does it have to infect every modern comedy.

It's good at times, average at times. \n\n**And Just Like That** -  Season 2 started bad, went to awful, then spiked up to Ok when Aden came back. But last episode is just floundering writing. Honestly does anyone care about the new 4 character from Season 1? the writers surely don't seem to care about them either. The whole show is just a trashy reboot of the vapid previous series. Boomers still suck and this show shows how out of touch they are. \n\n**How To With John Wilson** - Best show on Television. Watch it now and binge watch the first two seasons and you'll see what you've been missing. It's hilarious, clever, and fun. \n\n**Reservation Dogs** Season 3 has been uninteresting to me. It's losing me fast. I'm totally not invested anymore. Not sure what the point is here. \n\n**Justified: City Primevil** -  Ugh. They've taken a great legacy and turned it into just another grimey urban crime show that's just like every other one. Olyphant is going through the motions here. I'm super disappointed in this. Go back to Harlen County, or bring back some characters or else this is an EPIC FAIL. \n\n**Only Murders In The Building** Season 3 opening was pretty good as usual. Funny, witty, clever. Great chemistry. I'm down for this ride. \n\n**AfterParty** - wow. If you watch this right after Only Murders you'll feel like Apple execs shouted at their producers \"Get me a show that's solving a murder with an ensemble cast!!\".   It's funny but two shows with the exact same tone is one show too many.",

I'm really excited for the return of Damian Lewis, if it weren't for his personal tragedy this show could've been something special so maybe he helps bring it to a satisfying conclusion  \n* **Heels** - the first season really took me by surprise. I haven't watched wrestling in 20 years, but the small town drama and Americana that suffuses this show just struck a chord with me. I love it. Season 2 has my by the short and curlies, too.

I enjoyed seeing them plan for the new restaurant opening, but there were too many long conversations that were rather dull to watch. Not a big fan of Ayo Edebiri either. 6/10.\n\n**Hijack** \\- One of the most consistently entertaining shows I've seen in a while. Really good premise and the real-time structure was a great idea. It's so packed full of suspense. Idris Elba is excellent as always, but it's not just him that shines. It's a really great ensemble cast. Hoping for another season. 9/10.\n\n**A Small Light -** Pretty good. I knew a little about the Anne Frank story but it was still an interesting watch and gives you a different perspective of the events. Bel Powley, Joe Cole and Liev Schreiber were all excellent. Obviously an emotional watch but it was actually funnier than you might expect. It mostly works. 7/10.",

The two shows most adjacent to *Happy Valley* would be her cop series (which she only wrote/ran for the first three seasons), [*Scott & Bailey*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beJGiFnqCP0) and *Unforgiven.* I believe both are on Britbox in the US.\n\nHer family dramedy series, [*Last Tango in Halifax*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4gS00ZnT8)*,* has its first four (of five) seasons up on Netflix last I checked. It also co-stars Sarah Lancashire along with Nicola Walker, Derek Jacobi, and Anne Reid.\n\nHer historical drama, [*Gentleman Jack*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uBYRcP44M4)*,* is up on Max. It's based on the historical landowner, industrialist, mountaineer, and lesbian, Anne Lister, whose coded diaries are the basis of the show. It is not some hoity-toity boring costume drama; as is usual with a Wainwright show, the heroine is still a tough, wry, funny, embattled Northerner. Ditto her Bront\u00eb biodrama, [*To Walk Invisible*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-AFcgBTkbw)*,* but I think it's left PBS Passport.\n\nI wish the hell there were someplace I could send people to watch [*The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard*](https://www.facebook.com/BritBoxUK/videos/the-amazing-mrs-pritchard-now-streaming-on-britbox/325683065975153/), but AFAIK, it's only up on Britbox in the UK.*.* \n\nHer next show is going to be a historical adventure series, [*The Ballad of Renegade Nell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Renegade_Nell)*,* for Disney+ (UK, so might be Hulu in the US).",

Loved it to pieces, though that might partially be because I was coming off of San Diego Comic-Con when I found it. :)  Let's face it, no US show would ever be center on the *editing* bullpen of a comics company. The show is based on a JDrama (*Sleepeeer hit!,* which [Viki has in front of the paywall](https://www.viki.com/tv/38709c-sleepeeer-hit)), which in turn was based on the manga*, J\u016bhan Shuttai!* \n\nIn *Today's Webtoon*, the heroine is an Olympian-level judo competitor who, after a serious injury, has been rethinking what she wants to do and decides to embrace her second love: reading webtoons (webcomics) \\[as you do in Kdramas :\\]. She applies for corporate positions at webtoon companies, and wins a place as a contractor in the Neon webtoons service group. Another applicant with all the right education and qualifications is also hired into the group but he's her opposite: he knows nothing about comics and was hoping to be placed in a group more central to the company. He's also heard that the group is in danger of being dissolved within the year for poor performance. \n\nThe show centers around these two newcomers and the editorial group they work with, as well as with the artists both the old successful ones with egos and impossible deadlines they have to manage as well as the new ones they have to discover and nurture. It's full of office and corporate intrigue, unspoken love and longing, struggles for creativity and work/life balance, and it's all just really fun. Highly recommended.\n\nAnd as KDramas go, I'm also watching ***Uncanny Counter 2: Counterpunch*** (Netflix), because I was sucked into *Uncanny Counter* when it first arrived. This one's *based* on a superhero webtoon where the central character was a handicapped bullied high school student who, when he's in a coma, is bonded to a spirit and becomes a curly-haired superhero, a Counter, who just track and capture demons who've possessed humans (as you do in Kdramas). \n\nHe meets a band of older Counters who take him in and help train and guide him in his new role, and their undercover is that they run a noodle shop. They also wear tracksuits. It's *awesome.* Wirework, comedy, drama, melodrama, all the usual KDrama elements in a fast-paced tight show. Love it. \n\nThe second season is more or less on a par with the first, and it's following the same \"drops after it airs in Korea\" schedule. AFAICT that means a new episode at 7am PDT/10am EDT on Saturday and Sunday each week. This season, however, is shorter than the previous (12 instead of 16); not sure if that's because the show apparently switched networks in Korea or just because it's Netflix.\n\nI now debate whether I should add yet another superhero webtoon-based KDrama to the roster, since [*Moving*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVYw3biOgyE) just dropped its first 7 episode on Hulu and will do the Sat/Sun thing after that. But so far, the first episode hasn't grabbed me yet.\n\nBreaking up this post into three parts, 'cause it'd be insanely long otherwise.",

                    "body": "Part 2:\n\nLotta still-on-course comments follow.\n\n***Good Omens S2*** (Amazon Prime) was a lot of fun, but for me mostly because of the cast and the setting\u2014you really do just want to spend time with both. But the writing felt weirdly tensionless/directionless at times, and while i appreciated some John Finnemore touches, like the Talisker and the yellow car(!), I was hoping for it to be *more* Finnemore-like.  Both Gaiman and Finnemore can plot more strongly than this. Still, the final episode and end of the season made up for most of this for me. And I'm still looking forward to a 3rd season and finally getting to the plot Gaiman and Pratchett worked out for a *Good Omens* sequel. Just sad there was no *Staged* in joke or a Simon Evans cameo. :)\n\nOn my kinda-like TNT/USA \"Blue Sky\" shows, I had fun with ***Lincoln Lawyer S2B*** (Netflix) but really wish Netflix hadn't split the 10-episode season in half like that.\n\n***Family Law*** (CW) is a Canadian import family/legal drama that stars Jewel Staite and Victor Garber, and I'm actually finding S2 to be stronger than S1.\n\n***Dark Winds*** S2 (AMC/AMC+).  AMC airs 3 days after it drops on AMC+. I'm failing to see the logic, here.  But great show that gives Zahn McClarnon a chance to shine in the top spot instead of a supporting role. They're having a lot of fun adapting the Tony Hillerman Leaphorn & Chee series. This season is mostly based on *People of Darkness.* And color me surprised when Tricia Helfer popped up in the cast.\n\n***The Dragon Prince*** S5 (Netflix) made me very happy. To me, this show has been mostly consistent throughout the run, but I know others don't feel the same.  I'm looking forward to the final two seasons.\n\n***Futurama S11*** (Hulu) weirdly feels like they never left. :D\n\n***Only Murders in the Building S3*** and ***Reservation Dogs S3*** (Hulu) are as great as I expected them to be, and I'm having a rip-roaring time.\n\n***Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty S2*** (Max).  Again, pretty much holding steady.  For me, this show is a kicker on a secondary level to watch because I'm into the cinematography as well as the story and characters (not common for me aside from grumbling about the overuse of handheld, ultrawides, and whatever that new fisheye lens was *everybody* had to use last year from *Sandman* to *Weird! The Al Yankovic Story*). S1 of *Winning Time* made me sit up and take notice because it was shot entirely on film with a lot of care to simulate '70s film looks. And I'm delighted that they are **not** simply continuing the S1 look but advancing it. They've gone *so* '80s; they've stopped pushing (underexposing+overdeveloping)  the film to emphasize the grain and mess with the contrast so  everything looks a little slicker and cleaner. They've ditched 8mm in favor of VHS (!!; be still my beating heart). I'm **loving** it. Looks like they're gonna knock it out of the park again.\n\nComing up for me:\n\n* 8/20. [*The Winter King*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnZSkEBC_Y4). (MGM+). Bad Wolf is adapting Bernard Cornwell for ITVX/MGM+. Probably not my thing as I noped out on Sharpe long before he started writing his Arthurian stuff, but I'm willing to give it a taste.\n* 8/23. *Ahsoka* (Disney+). This one you know. If you need to prep: binge *Star Wars: Rebels*, not *Clone Wars*.\n* 8/30. *Archer S14* (FXX/Hulu).  Final season.\n* 9/1. *Wheel of Time* S2 (Amazon Prime). I remain blissfully ignorant of the book series on purpose. I also used to watch *Xena* and *Legend of the Seeker.* Give me Daniel Henney and Rosamund Pike and I'm fine. YMMV dramatically.\n* 9/3. [*Unforgotten S5*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl47zcRao34) (PBS Masterpiece). Let's see if they can  overcome the loss of the main character/actor.  I think it's likely.\n* 9/12. [*Welcome to Wrexham* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuiXCWk_TwQ) (FX/Hulu). Should be good. Hard to avoid spoilers, though. :D :D\n* 9/21. [*Sex Education* S4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgJotJx8Iio) (Netflix). Final season, and our last chance to see Ncuti Gatwa as not-the-Doctor. :)",

I'll probably just read the recaps of the last episodes. I will say the show makes me wanna delve deeper into Roman Empire history as well as Greek Mythologies. If anyone knows some good books I can get...I need to exercise my reading muscle.\n\nI did end up watching From S2 and I enjoyed it way better than Domina. Hoping S3 is the last... hahaha. Or at least they don't open end it. That's one thing I hate about most Amazon movies is they leave you to make up your own ending. I like everything wrapped up in a pretty bow, thank you very much!\n\nEnded up finishing Virgin River S5. Ended in a cliffhanger. I watched it distracted though.\n\nTried to watch new season of Sweet Magnolias but I couldn't get in the mood.\n\nSomeone had recommended Deadloch when I mentioned I liked Fisk. I remember now that I got turned off by the opening sex scene. I prefer build up vs in your face right off the bat. Maybe I'll give it another chance. It gave me Mare of Easttown vibe. I never got to finish that show bc I don't have Max subscription anymore.\n\nReally excited about Ragnarok S3. Yet for some reasons, I can't bring myself to re-watch S1&2. Anyone rewatching or you just gonna go straight to S3? This one of them shows that feels like it's still fresh in my mind.",

These scenes are boring and cringey and are adding nothing but distraction to whatever is going on at any point. Besides, the religious subplot made it even worse.\n\nAnother annoying character: the cigar smoking woman child, what's up with her beating her superior officer and getting away with it? In what army exactly does this happen? Even in high school which apparently she left prematurely, there would've been more consequences than simply walking away after.\n\nAdditionally, the writers thought it's cool to replace fuck with frak and force all characters to use that word, not sure whether anyone enjoys this other than the writers themselves, it just adds more cringe material.\n\nI understand it's science fiction, and unusual technologies are expected, however, regarding the ships that are allegedly \"faster than light\" this has been proven to be theoretically impossible, which to achieve, an infinite amount of energy is required, so it seems the writers forgot about the science part.",
