Only wish the season was longer because the pace is getting fast. \n\n**Burning Body** - Needed something to watch so gave this Spanish Netflix show based on true events a try.  I\u2019ll be honest main reason being \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 of **Money Heist** fame.  Knew nothing of the real murder case but found this to be quite good. Quick google and looks like the casting was pretty spot on. Crazy story and will look forward to diving into the true story afterwards. \n\n**Creature** - basically the Frankenstein set in Turkey.  Gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. High quality and entertaining story. \n\nAlso **Masters of the Air** and **Criminal Record**",

I'm kind of disappointed with the way they portrayed the gods because we don't really get to see their power, but maybe that's a thing saved for future reveals.  Also the places they travel to (except the tourist spots like Vegas) always seem so...empty.  Lifeless.  Feels kind of weird, almost like they were trying to save on the budget.\n\nSemi-binging **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters** and have 1 episode left.  Really enjoying this show, but glad I waited because some of the sidetracks (like so much time dedicated to May's background) would have been frustrating as heck if it was a 1 week detour from the story progressing instead of a 1 hour detour.  Before watching this I had no idea that Wyatt Russell was the son of Kurt Russell.  I don't see the facial resemblance but I sometimes hear it in the voice.  Also took me to the 9th episode to remember that one of Kurt Russell's most famous roles was as Wyatt Earp, so I assume that's where the name came from.\n\nViewing for this weekend:\n\n* Finish Monarch Legacy of Monsters.  Heard good things about the finale so I am excited.\n\n* Masters of the Air. Ep3\n\n* Night Country Ep4\n\n* Babylon Berlin S4 (time permitting).

Heading the large cast are Richard Chamberlin as Father Ralph De Bricassart, and Rachel Ward as Meghan (Meggie) Clearly, Ralph's eventual love interest and nemesis.\n\nThe decades-long saga is set mostly in Australia, and to a lesser degree, Rome and other places in Europe, from 1920 to the 1960's. It begins at a large, prosperous sheep-station, Drogheda, in the outback of New South Wales, presided over by the steely (and somewhat perverse), childless widow, Mary Carson (Barbara Stanwyck). Fr. Ralph is an ambitious young priest, who has been banished to that remote area for defying his superior, and he is a frequent visitor at Drogheda. Mary really enjoys sparring with and tormenting him. \n\nInto this situation is brought Mary's impoverished brother, Paddy, and his family (which includes his youngest child, Meggie), to help work the station, and to dangle the prospect of inheriting all of it before him. When the family arrives, and Fr. Ralph (whom almost every woman in the story would like to seduce) greets them, it is immediately clear that Meggie's life-goal stands before her, even though she is so young. \n\nWhat follows is epic and tragic in every sense. Oedipal conflicts, transgressive desire, violence, pageantry, natural disaster, divine versus human love, and more, fill out the sprawling plot. \n\nDespite the fact that the outback looks a lot like California, and the part of the story that takes place in Queensland bears a striking resemblance to Hawaii, and most of the Australians (but not all) talk a lot like Americans, the 8 hours or so are very gripping. Daryl Duke's deft direction and  Henry Mancini's musical score help keep things moving along nicely. The acting is very good, especially Christopher Plummer (Archbishop Vittorio di Contini-Verchese) as Fr. Ralph's mentor, advancing him through the ranks of the Catholic Church. Definitely worth a look!",

However my love for Seth McFarland is so great that I binged the entire series last weekend and....I like it.  It's a little hammy in parts.  Gets a little \"lesson learny\" in parts  but it's pretty funny.  Solid comedy and now that it's out, I need Seth to get back to The Orville.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrue Detective - Night Country.  Holy shit this is good.  I mean good, good.  Dark, tense, scary and Jodie Foster just commands the screen whether she's investigating a grisly murder or putting up a Christmas tree. Just remarkable. And it's not just Jodie Foster - the whole thing is a noir/horror masterpiece.  This is one of these seasons I'm going to have to watch three or four times just to make sure I get every great thing out of it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Traitors - Season 2.  I will be honest; I did not finish season 1 until recently and I don't want to spoil it but the end of Season 1 put me off a bit.  It was uncomfortable.  I was glad for the winner, but watching the losers lose was rough.  Season 2 though is an all celebrity - well, reality show celebrity - cast.  So, I'm not emotionally enough invested in a winner.  I don't care if any of these people win.  I want to watch them lose and I suppose that's the real draw this season.  Still fun, hyper enhanced drama and manufactured intrigue with the ever charming Alan Cumming preening his way around a Scottish castle as host and MC of a gaggle of F list celebs plotting to \"murder\" each other.",

While I enjoyed the slower pace of the previous seasons, it is a nice change of pace.  I'm really happy to hear the show has been renewed.\n\n**True Detective S4 EP3 & 4** \\-- I have many criticisms of the show, but I still find myself tuning in to watch this because there are many elements that I like, but unfortunately it's just not always executed well. I wish there was more chemistry between the two main leads. Also while I generally love horror movies, a lot of the horror imagery and scenes in EP3 and EP4 felt really B-movie-ish. If the show was a bit more self-conscious of its reliance of overused horror movie tropes, I think it would work better, but it sometimes comes off as a bit cheesy and pulls me out of the show. Anyway, despite all of this, I find this season entertaining but far from a masterpiece.\n\n**Sakura** \\-- A Japanese morning drama from 2002 featuring a Japanese-American young woman from Hawaii who decides to move to Japan to teach English at an all boys school. With over 120 episodes, there's a lot to watch, but each episode is only 15 minutes long. Lots of cliffhangers to keep you watching, and while the plot is generally lighthearted, I like the exploration of the cultural differences between Japan and America, but from a Japanese-American point of view, which is really cool since I'm also Japanese American.",

My spouse gave up after the first episode because he does not enjoy shows that make him uncomfortable (he won\u2019t even watch the earlier seasons of The Office). And even among people who loved the show, it seems like the finale was divisive, also for good reason, so this is a really hard one to recommend across the board.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a genre of film that I don\u2019t know the name for, but I call them \u201csnapshot in time\u201d movies. They are usually character studies, and most of the time nothing really happens & there\u2019s not much of a character arc. If you like these kinds of films, and you also like cringe comedy/ shows that make you uncomfortable, then this is worth checking out. It\u2019s definitely a niche audience, I think!\n\nPersonally, I loved the finale & it has sat with me, but it was definitely the most uncomfortable I\u2019ve felt from a Nathan Fielder project. It\u2019s like he just keeps upping the ante. Why I enjoy this, I have no idea. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0",

            "body": "**The Curse** on Showtime via Paramount+. Holy Shit. This blew my mind. I loved it. I cried for the last 5 minutes or so of the finale. People saying they \"don't understand\" the very straightforward plot confuse me. A married couple struggling with both internal personal and relationship issues attempt to film and pitch a reality show based on their experience gentrifying a rough neighborhood in New Mexico. A series of small mishaps snowballs out of control and one or more characters finds themselves dramatically changed by the snowball of events. \nBut the plot isn't confusing, I think people are mis-identifying what's confusing about it. The style, approach, tone and vibe are confusing AF. It's social horror, extremely black comedy, and razor-wire tension/cringe comedy. It's art, and I don't say that lightly. \n\nI have SO much to say about this show but I won't blather on. People who liked Maniac, Atlanta, Sorry to Bother You, various Nathan Fielder projects, cringe humor like The Office (although this is MUCH darker, it's like 10 hours of The Dinner Party/Scott's Tots) and various Safdie Bros projects will like it. People who watch tv scrolling their phone (I've done it, I get it) will not. \n\n**True Detective, Season 3 + 4** Season 3 I'm done with, 4 is ongoing. Season 3 was...solid. I didn't like the time jumps and felt it was an artifact of its time--the whole puzzle box, keep the audience guessing, Westworld thing. I would have liked 3 episodes in 1980, 3 in 1990, 2 today, boom done. Season 4 is fun, popcorn TV. I'm a little concerned there's only 6 episodes and we're going on 4 and very little has happened, especially with a HUGE mystery like this but eh we'll see. \n\nMovies: Eileen on Prime. I waited eagerly for this to drop down to $5.99 for a rental and it was...fine. I suspect this book was really, really difficult to film due to the fact it's 90% internal monologue. Perfect casting with Anne Hathaway, she's always had a little menace in her creamy exterior and just a bit too wide smile. The movie looks gorgeous and captures quite a bit of the perverse appeal of the book but falls pretty seriously short in many ways.",

There are some decent older air force movies (like 12 O Clock High) but even that one kind of blurs together with other air force movies of that era.\n\nIn CONTEXT of other WWII Air Force movies I've seen, I think Masters of the Air is good so far. The WWII movies were usually reticent to say ANYTHING negative about 'our boys' but its good this show is starting out focusing on mistakes made and stressing the vulnerability of the plane crews - it seems like the show is working up to how the air force will learn from their mistakes, and also following the crew who have to bail out behind enemy territory. Due to special effects advancements, this show is also better at capturing what the flight crews were experiencing in battle.\n\nBut as good as \"Band of Brothers\"? No, but I think it comes with the territory of this element of long distance warfare.\n\nI will say also, I think Austin Butler is really good so far, he is less a 'character' than an \"Icon\" of the kind of person (calm, intelligent) that makes for a good pilot. I don't have a problem with that.",

Barry Keoghan, Austin Butler, Callum Turner, and Anthony Boyle. unf, so far so steamy. unfortunately, we haven't really got any of those male bonding scenes yet like Top Gun's famous volleyball scene. but i will be keeping a lookout. the dudes arent assholes and so far ive been enjoying the dialogue and brotherhood. still no interest in learning more about WW2 or their technology though (i did have to google what the hell flak was tho lol). haven't watched Part III yet tho\n\n- *Percy Jackson & the Olympians* on Disney+. i never read the books. i saw the first movie, which i enjoyed. i also enjoyed this show! it was a fun little adventure. i watched it week-by-week, but i think it is better enjoyed as a binge imo. a nice show to just turn your brain off and watch some shenanigans\n\nNon-Fiction:\n\n- *Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones* on Netflix. yeah. we have all watched/read/heard about them and all the usual suspects are there. there's some interesting 'new' stuff found so far, and i have yet to complete the last episode. it's only 4 episodes and goes by relatively quick. this felt similar to a meta study done on Blue Zones almost, with the host, Dan Buettner, acknowledging the changes that increased globalization have caused to these blue zones. (like mentioning that Okinawa is not only no longer a blue zone, but has the highest obesity levels in all of Japan now). i recommend it\n\n- *You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment* on Netflix. another plant-based experiment doc. you know it is in that Netflix plant-based universe because Dr. Greger is on there! lol. he is a huge advocate for that diet/lifestyle and is the leading doctor for this. so he is featured in all of the big docs, and was the creator of the book *How to Not Die*. so i feel like him being featured lends credence to this series doc. i havent finished it yet, however it is another 4 episode doc that seemed fun so i'll finish it off and update my opinion later on it\n\n---\nGoing to Start/Looking forward to:\n\n- *Mr. & Mrs. Smith* on Amazon Prime. premiers today! just gotta have time to sit and watch (should have waited for this post, oh well!). this is gonna be the next show i watch, and ive been anticipating it.\n\n- School Spirits, The Fall of the House of Usher, Criminal Record, and Absolute Beginners are gonna be started soon and see if anything pulls me in to binge",

I finally picked up **Generation Kill** after starting it and never finishing several years ago. Really interesting, especially in comparing those guys to the guys in Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Added bonus was realizing it was filmed in the town I grew up in. I finished **The Curse**, and enjoyed it? Or, enjoyed it as much as one possibly could. Love shows that make me uncomfortable (but not in an explicit way).\u00a0",

They keep it all really vague, which is good on one hand because there's this sense of suspense (well, that is suspense, the writer dosing the information administered to the viewer), but on the other hand it kind of keeps the whole thing ungrounded. For example, there's no information about the training of the couple. And you really could convey that information in scenes where they expertly deliver that training, say, managing guns or a particular way of behaving and going about things that surely intelligence people all around the world share. But there's not so much of that. Of course they said that they weren't allowed in such and such agencies, but still, you would think that they would have as a second nature how to behave in public (no \"I got a gun bitch\"), how to behave in front of a gun wound (or just put faces and let the guy die, sure), stuff like that. I know this is basically an entertaining piece, and in a way the whole action part is a charade going on over the main theme, the evolution of this couple. But my feeling is that it could have been perfect if you upped it a notch in terms of realism, it would make the action so much more exciting, the stakes would feel more palpable (it would separate it a bit from the realm of a live-action \"The Incredibles\" typr of thing). Also, so many non-sequiturs, all these stories that come from nowhere and go nowhere. Anyway, it was good.!<\n\n\n**WILTY**. Enjoying thoroughly this new season of Would I lie to you, which is my go-to panel show from the UK. I was reading the other day that Bob Mortimer has had a health scare, so I guess he won't be appearing this time around. Also I was thinking while watching this last iteration, does Rob Brydon know the truthness or falseness of a given story beforehand or does he discover it along with us the audience? If he does, then he's a hell of an actor, manifesting surprise, inquiring the storytellers and such.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0And so, it's the beginning of the end of an era. **Curb** s12e01 was just fantastic.

Also seemed derivative of the better *Narcos*. \n\nReluctantly I'm watching some *Ted Lasso*, because I'm now an Apple subscriber due to *Masters of the Air* which I love, especially the acting interplay of leads Butler, Turner and Keoghan, the historicity plus good supporting cast and a wolf-dog (dancing husky) too.  There really was a husky mascot in the \"Bloody Hundredth\" air bomber group on which the series is based. Those USAAF guys were at such high risk of mission death (only about a third of them survived their tours of duty), they were granted some leeway for hijinks in their down time. The series goes into it as well as astonishing aerial battles.\n\nAll of *MotA* can't be weekend-binged yet, being released now only one episode per week until the series of 9 total episodes ends in later March. Episode 4 of *MotA* comes out late tomorrow night in my time zone, with the first 3 also available. Then another week to wait for 5, etc. \n\n*Ted Lasso*'s got several seasons ready to go, not as treacly as I thought it'd be--- actually pretty good to justify the awards, some laughs, including strong believable relationships among the supporting cast.  \n\nI've liked most of the Apple series I've sampled so far.  *Silo* with Rebecca Ferguson is amazing. *The Morning Show* has experienced and award-winning female actors and also Jon Hamm and Billy Crudup (a great actor also in a single funny season of an Apple series about alternative history and selling moon flight tickets). *For All Mankind* is another alternative history about space flight that has many episodes/multiple seasons I've liked. *Lessons in Chemistry*, a limited series based on a book, also good. And then there's *Monarch*, with a bunch of godzilla and similar types of beasts plus Kurt Russell still being tough (great younger cast too, including Japanese settings).  Lots of other offerings I haven't had time to sample yet. \n\nIt seems to me that whereas Max is moving more to pitch sports and its old catalog of classic prestige shows like the *Sopranos* and *Succession* which are long-wrapped,  Apple is stepping in with new prestige TV involving really good acting, writing, direction and locations/cgi. That would fit with the movies they're helming too. And no, they don't pay me or even know anything about me as the bots collect the monthly subscription fee. (There's a free trial period that hooked me in the first place!)\n\nDisappointed in S4 of *True Detective*.  Love Jodie Foster generally; she's great in this year's *Nyad,* with other great actors, which was and may still be on Netflix as a film. But for S4 *TD* I find the supernatural woo too disconnected from the real-world murders, and too many inexperienced actors in the cast that Foster seemingly needs to lift up to make believable (and it's too big a job, I'm not buying it, the interactions never ring true to me). Loved S1 of *True Detective*, btw, and while S2 and S3 didn't top it, they were good too. This latest offering looks to me with S4 as though Max is not putting enough money into good actors' salaries or good writing. \n\nAs the industry keeps changing, and our content options evolve too, interesting times for cinephiles and tv watchers. Thanks everybody for weighing in about the programs you watch!",

This was a very solid action show that was better than Wu Assassins but not quite on the very high standard of Warrior. It was a worthwhile watch though and a very solid action show. Interesting to see Michelle Yeoh in an unexpected type of role while I thought her characters sons played by Justin Chien and Sam Song Li were the standouts on the show. \n\n**The Curse** - I loved the premise of this one but was a little wary and nervous as I\u2019m not keen on Felder\u2019s awkward comedy as a rule. It is usually just too cringe inducing for me. Not because I think he is unskilled but just because of how deliberately awkward and embarrassing it all is! I think The Curse being entirely fictional helped a lot with making that aspect of Felder\u2019s work more bearable for me. So what did I think of The Curse? It was really weird, and sort of what I was expecting, but also strangely compelling and very watchable. That ending was\u2026unexpected, for sure, and I not sure if I like it or not but now that I\u2019ve had time to ponder it I do think it was a good fit for this very strange show. This was a weird limited series that definitely had that A24 feel to it! \n\n**The Winter King** - I was a tad disappointed with this historical, and more realistic Arthurian take, based on the books of Bernard Cornwell but the good news is I did feel like it got better as it progressed so I probably would return for a second season. \n\n**Domino Day** - This BBC paranormal ended up being surprisingly engaging and fun. Good pacing, fun characters, and an interesting take on witches in a modern day setting. Nothing overly original but good enough that I binged through it quite quickly. \n\n**The Serial Killer\u2019s Wife** - A short but twisty thriller following a women who\u2019s life falls apart after her husband gets arrested at his fancy birthday party on suspicion of being a serial killer! Not perfect by a long shot but this was short and surprisingly watchable. I just managed to squeeze it in before Paramount+ gutted the service of several interesting British originals. Which is a real pity as their offerings were a lot better in the region than we have seen from Netflix or Disney in my opinion. Pity they are getting out of international originals! \n\nNext up I\u2019m going to try and squeeze in **The Doll Maker** and **A Bloody Lucky Day** on Paramount before they disappear in the latest round of streaming content gutting. I\u2019ve also still got **Griselda** and the newly released **Mr & Mrs Smith** in my sight line!",

I'm excited to continue with the rest of the series. \n\nFargo s5 - 3 eps in, pretty good so far. Performances are really well done. It has that good ol Fargo feel to it. \n\nTrue Detective s4 - really hard to stick with this show. The only thing keeping me coming back to it every week is the atmosphere and setting of the show. I love the idea of a crime series set in rural part of Alaska where it's constantly dark, it's the perfect setting for this kind of show. However, this season feels so cheesy and cliche. Tbf, I've only watched s1 of TD , but I've watched tons of crime dramas, supernatural thrillers and this show kinda fails to be good at either aspect. The writing is bad, the performances are meh. But I'll probably keep coming back lol",

It's nothing amazing but a solid procedural, I'm a sucker for a gimmick and blind detective is a good one. Three episodes have been released. \n\nI'm still watching [One More Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27990867/), a sitcom about the people working in a second-hand sports equipment store. It's alright. I miss Kim's Convenience so much. \n\n[The Irrational](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16288838/) and [Found](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071808/) haven't impressed me much, they're going to get another chance next seasons since they've both been renewed, hope it will improve. \n\n[Death & Other Details](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15439048/) is a delight, it has Mandy Patinkin playing a more cynical Agatha Christie type detective trying to solve a murder on a cruise, it has a lot of great shady characters. I love it so I know it will be cancelled by Hulu. \n\n[Mr. & Mrs. Smith](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14044212/) is cute, it has too many cooks syndrome but I liked it.",

That's so much action and tons going on comparatively to 90% of other content. The characters being able to talk and scenes breathing in between all of that stuff is a good thing and where the quality of the show comes from, in my opinion. I've found the characters just having conversation to be as engaging as the rest of what I mentioned. I think Glover and Erskine have great chemistry on screen and the mumblecore-lite improvy conversation stuff works for me especially with the comedy.\n\nI also don't really find it similar to Atlanta at all, that might just come from Glover and Murai stylisically/pacing wise.

Sad how it ended. Really feels like the show could go another 2-3 seasons. Easy watch with some underrated themes and the acting toward the very end is top notch.\n\n**Blackberry** | Drama | AMC+  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 | 83\n\nThis was originally a movie but looks like AMC+ revamped it into a 3-part mini series. I enjoyed watching this. Glen Howerton is a special talent and needs more serious roles.\n\n`Currently Watching`\n\n**Top Boy** | Drama | Netflix / Channel 4  \nSeason 1  \nLast episode completed: 1  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 | 81\n\nPretty solid first episode. I'm intrigued by the premise. Probably need the full first season to be hooked. Only 4 episode seasons too before the Netflix renewal.\n\n**The Challenge: Battle for a New Champion** | Reality | MTV (soon to be Paramount+) Season 39  \nLast episode completed: 16  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | 77\n\nThat last episode was by far the best of the season but allowing Jay and Michelle to dictate this season shows the sad state of where The Challenge is. Ready for All Stars and season 40.\n\n**Russian Doll** | Dramedy | Netflix  \nSeason 2  \nEpisodes completed: 4/7  \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | 77\n\nJust really not that into this show. Not sure if I'll even finish it. Anyone want to convince me to?",

The plot simply isn't anything you didn't already see in the movie and I think the movie just executed it better. I think that the whole concept, if you follow the movie that is, can't be more than a limited series, yet they set it up to where there will seemingly be a second season, which I guess will be the third act of the movie in essence?  \nAll in all, you're better off just watching the movie instead of watching this drawn out version of it. I do admit thought that the scenes with the pretentious, pseudo intellectual therapist were pretty funny in that sort of \"its a sitcom moment but its trying to be serious\" type of way where you get what it's trying to do, but it doesn't quite do it, but it's still funny.  \n  \n6/10.  \n  \n__________________________________________  \n  \n**Monsieur Spade**  \n  \nWatched the first two episodes and while I do think there's something interesting here, I'm not entirely sold on it just yet.

Different storyline than the movie as well, it's not like they are trying to remake the movie in the show, just some similarities in premise. \n\nThe movie was like True Lies (only not as well written) and the TV show is like the show Patriot, honestly not comparable IMO aside from the name and general premise of a married spy couple.

I guess the name of the game here is subverting expectations. Yes, it starts off with a quite prominent Atlanta vibe (the photography, the director and the writer, the mood, the conversationalist nature of the script) but it keeps adding to it. It's pulpy and it's silly. These characters have the moral compass of a toddler too, which made me a bit uneasy, especially on episode 1 (for all we know, they are working for a terrorist organization, and there's zero reflecting on the dead bodies they leave behind. Hey, at least John Wick gave you something to latch on to, even if it was really flimsy). It's got some cool action sequences. It's got a cinematic vibe to it, with all these amazing locations. Beautiful score too. It keeps you guessing, not just about the episode, but about how it fits in the whole picture. Idk, maybe I'll come back here once I'm done and say that they didn't land it and the whole thing came tumbling down like a house of cards. We'll see. I like these two. Well, I liked them beforehand. I think they had great chemistry together, some scenes felt really naturalistic and \"fly on the wall\".!<\n\n**In The Know**, episode 1. As it turns out, if you parody an obnoxious human type, you still get obnoxiousness. \r  \n\r  \n**Masters of the air**, episode 1. Didn't believe a thing on this one.

You can be depressed and lonely and give something to the character. Dull. It\u2019s dull. The lighting is dull and gray. The dialogue is dull and slow and boring. Hardly any music. So sad\u2026",

By negative reviews I'm talking about people critical of the standard things one criticises, ie; the acting, or the writing including any overuse of tropes and cliches, unbelievable characters and plot, lack of a coherent story logic etc. I can't comment on the idea that a significant portion of the critics are sexist trolls - from what I've seen they don't seem to make up a significant amount of the critics.\n\nWith these popular criticisms in mind, I'm enjoying the show so far. I haven't really noticed a lot of these common complaints so much, but I'm open to the idea that I'm just missing them.\n\nFor those that don't like Season 4, what are your complaints?",
