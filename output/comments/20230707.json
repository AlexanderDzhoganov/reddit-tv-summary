I\u2019ll watch anything that involves Jody Hill and Danny McBride. **Eastbound & Down** and **Vice Principals** were absolute gold and both are in my top shows of all time, so I\u2019m just ecstatic whenever we get new material from these guys. Uncle Baby Billy all day!\n\n\n* Despite some mixed reviews, I thought **Silo** was a pretty awesome show. Binged it all in two days. Good cast, good writing, good outcome. Apple TV+ has really been putting out some great stuff the last year or two.\n\n\n* Another show with some pretty mixed reviews was **Rabbit Hole**. I found it to be pretty enjoyable. I thought their ability to consistently have twists was legit, but being able to keep the story fluid and entertaining all the while was pretty unique. I thought this was a great role for Kiefer Sutherland and I think he pulled it off pretty damn well.\n\n\n* It\u2019s great to have **The Bear** back. I\u2019m only two episodes into the second season since I wanted to rewatch the first season prior to starting the second, which was a good idea since there were a few things that I didn\u2019t remember at all. Love the cast and the chemistry they were able to build between them, and I\u2019m excited to see how that continues to progress this second season. Especially with the guests they have for season two. I\u2019m so glad Matty Matheson is on this show \u2014 part of me wishes he was used a little bit more, but that may be what makes his character so special.\n\n\n* Just finished the fifth season of **Unforgotten**. I\u2019m so glad I stumbled on this show this past December. If you\u2019re a fan of detective shows, this should definitely be on your watchlist. If you\u2019re a fan of British television as well, then you need to be watching this right now. I was a bit surprised to find out they made a fifth season after what happened at the end of season 4, but somehow they still made it work. It made me really miss >!Cass and the chemistry she had with Sunny and the rest of her department!<, but somehow they still made the show work. Plus, the intro/music is definitely one of the best of all time as far as series go.\n\n\n* Going to try and start on **Happy Valley**, **Shrinking**, and **Class of 09** soon. And **Warrior**, obviously! A lot of series are starting/returning the next month or two, including **Tacoma FD**, **Winning Time**, **OMITB**, **Breeders**, and **Reservation Dogs**.",

            "body": "I just finished two \"quirky\" crime dramas I would like to recommend. Both have 8 episodes, and both primarily deal with one case stretching over their entire 8-episode run.\n\n1\n\nThe first one is ***Panhandle***. It is billed as a \"Roku original\", but originated in some unknown quarter of the streaming world (\u201cSpectrum\u201d). In Germany it streams via freevee.  \n\nThe show takes place in a godforsaken corner of Florida's panhandle, and the two protagonists are a frustrated traffic cop and a psychologically damaged shut-in.  \nThe cop, Cammie, shows very little professional ambition; she says she only does the job for the pay and the benefits. Since the town has bankrupted itself, the mayor has fired all the cops. Except for Cammie; and he only keeps her on the payroll on the strict instruction that all she is allowed to do is stand beside the highway with a speed gun and try to make the town more money in speeding fines than they have to invest in her salary.  \n\nThe shut-in, Bellwether Prescott, is the last surviving scion of a once wealthy sugar-growing dynasty. The company has been sold, his wife is dead, and so is his father. Bellwether\u2019s mother devotes her entire existence to watching over him, because since his wife's death Bellwether has become mentally unstable, possibly suicidal, and is also psychologically incapable of setting a foot outside of the gates of their decaying mansion. A female exterminator/stripper as well as a Native-American stoner guy are the only people who he has contact with from time to time.  \n\nBellwether's main hobby/distraction is solving unsolved murders. And that hobby comes in handy when a body turns up uninvited; which also is what causes Bellwether and Cammie to meet for the first time.  \n\nThere are some minor cases here and there, but from the second episode onwards the entire series is focused on one particular case.\n\n**tone: The tone of this comedic crime show is somewhere between** *Monk*, *The Glades*, **and** *Perception*. **Many of the minor characters are also of the \"Florida-man\" type, which adds to the surreal tone. It feels a bit too loud and ridiculous at times, but it works.** \n\nThe cast is great and the show looks really solid as well.\n\nThe final episode is a bit of a disappointment. Apart from yet another twist (apparently, you can never have enough of them these days), and the inevitable cliff-hanger for the (hopefully) following season, there is an awful lot of character-shuffling going on. The show-runners seem to want to position everyone in a specific \u201cplace\u201d in life for the start of the (hopefully) coming season. With all that shuffling, and with all the other things shoehorned in, the character motivations take a backseat, and not all of the decisions make sense or are explained well enough.\n\nStill, a show well worth watching. You\u2019ll know after an episode or two if the tone of the show suit you.\n\n2\n\nThe second show is the Australian show ***Deadloch***, which was made by Prime and should therefore be available on Prime wherever you are.  \n\nThe show follows female police officer Dulcie Collins, who used to work homicide in Sydney but has sinced moved to rural Tasmania with her wife (a laywer/veterinarian) who had decided they needed a less stressfull life. Their rural town, Deadloch, has a new ambitious mayor (who is also the local doctor) who wants to turn this nowhere-place into a hippster travel spot. The type of visitors this attracts, in combination with the arrival of at least two lesbian couples in the past few years, has created a silent schism in the town between the \"original\" redneck inhabitants and the newcomers. And, of course, there are some actual Natives living there as well, who are not too pleased with any of the others. And when a body turns up, it all slowly boils over.\n\n**tone: The whole show has strong** *Twin Peaks* **vibes; and it also feels a bit like someone had given New Zealand's** *Brokenwood* **a course of steroids.**  \n\nDulcie is the pretty much the only normal, grounded person in the whole town. When the body is found, the higher-ups send her someone \"more experienced\" from Darwin to run the show, but that person is even more nuts than the rest of the townsfolk. For my taste, all of this could have been dialled back by at least 20%, but it is still entertaining. Most of the male characters are 2-dimensional so don't offer the actors much (although they do get a kick out of hamming it up), but there are some really interesting female characters for the cast to sink their teeth into.\n\nLike *Panhandle*, *Deadloch* looks really good as well.\n\n\n\nBoth of these shows are of high quality. But *Deadloch* might possibly be more ambitious and \"out there\".",

I highly recommend her other shows if you haven't seen them, and if you can cross genres. *Happy Valley* is fairly unique in tone but all her shows tend to center around tough, wry, funny Northern heroines.\n\nTwo other crime dramas she did are both on Britbox (US) at the moment: the cop show, [*Scott & Bailey*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beJGiFnqCP0), and the crime thriller, *Unforgiven.* Both of which star Suranne Jones. Weirdly, the latter recently got remade into a Netflix movie with Sandra Bullock, *The Unforgiveable* that Wainwright wasn't involved in.\n\nSarah Lancashire also stars in Wainwright's family dramedy, [*Last Tango in Halifax*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4gS00ZnT8) (Netflix), along with Nicola Walker, Derek Jacobi, and Anne Reid.  You can also find Wainwright's first family dramedy, [*At Home With the Braithwaites*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiyO8kYfusg) on a lot of FAST services (Freevee, Roku, Tubi, Pluto), weirdly, they're all missing the first episode (the first season has six episodes; and all the FAST services list it as five episodes and start with the second one, after the lottery win setup \\[eyeroll\\]).\n\nStill no good US streaming source for [*The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard*](https://www.facebook.com/BritBoxUK/videos/the-amazing-mrs-pritchard-now-streaming-on-britbox/325683065975153/). (sigh).\n\nWainwright's also done two historical biodramas: one about the Bront\u00ebs: [*To Walk Invisible*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-AFcgBTkbw) (Crackle), and one about Anne Lister, [*Gentleman Jack*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uBYRcP44M4) (Max).\n\nHer next series is going to be a historical adventure series for Disney+, [*The Ballad of Renegade Nell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Renegade_Nell*).\n\nBTW. Weird trivia. Both Sally Wainwright and Russell T. Davies ([who are old friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLNr1e9jIY)) early on in their careers wrote for the ITV soap opera, *Coronation Street.* So, the first time Sally Wainwright wrote dialogue for Sarah Lancashire? [It was on *Corrie*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0867873/reference/).",

The costumes are fun, the music is *banging*, Lily Rose Depp has real star presence, there's some really interesting scenes--notably the one where the character tries and tries to get a music video scene right and breaks down. I also unabashedly love the \"Chaim\" character and Eli Roth's character (as well as every side character except the Vanity Fair journalist and Xander and that terrible self indulgent nudist gal) and the throwaway line \"I don't have time to get into the Jewish thing with you today\". I *adore* the cinematography, some of the shots are pure 90s thriller gorgeous. If the show had leaned into the sleazy Hollywood of it all, it could have really had something. \n\nI have to say this too: if you go over to the r/romancebooks subReddit there are *hundreds* of women asking for *exactly what this show is*, in embarrassing detail. A sadistic man exploiting, even torturing a woman in a \"sexy\" way. Reviewers who say that women don't want or like this are *wrong*. Now, do they want the dead eyes, rat tail, and frozen features of icky The Weeknd doing it? No. But they are eating up \"dark romance\" that is *exactly this* by the hundreds of thousands and making those authors millions of dollars, for real. It churns my stomach and irritates the feminist in me but I'm telling you, on God, there's plenty of women that if some model-hot 8-pack dude with pouty lips and more charisma than Abel was doing these scenes (and these scenes were slightly better written), it would be transporting them. \n\nI have much more to say about this show but I'll leave it at that...for now .\n\n**YellowJackets Season 2** I spent the 4th eve and the 4th binge watching. Wow, it left me feeling hollow--a rarity for media. The impact of the horrors the girls go through is intense. I'm not sure where they can go from here on Season 3 that's not...in exceptionally poor taste, shall we say. I find the cutesy amateur sleuth candy-coated silliness of the adult scenes jarring compared to the Cormac McCarthy 'red in tooth and claw' teen scenes. While I get that an entire show of grinding misery and animalistic survivalism isn't really...watchable, I think the writers and directors missed the mark on matching the two sides. Also, I couldn't care less about Callie. \n\n**I'm a Virgo** Prime. What a masterpiece. Jesus Christ. I don't even know where to start. Afro-Surrealism at its finest. Boots Riley occasionally gives into juvenile impulses (*please* stop with all the barfing and gross out food humor!) and scatalogical humor that to me, does little to enhance the show, and is off putting (maybe that's the point?) but the show is 100x more original, beautiful, interesting, and vibrant than almost anything on TV. There's a purity that's hard to pinpoint, a joy that radiates off the screen. There's a scene set in the in-universe cartoon show \"Parking Tickets\", a monologue so beautiful it made me cry (snow falling monologue), and I showed it to my husband. He said it's nihilistic, which made everything click to me. Boots is a Communist, a philosophy that often shares space with nihilism. I don't find nihilism sad, there's bleak beauty in it, in fact. But I went to Russia in the 90s and feel deeply, deeply in love with the elegiacal sadness and gloom of the country so there's that.   \n\n**Glamorous** on Netflix. A cute background-tv show. Highly watchable, even if it's a clear vehicle for the YouTube star at the center. Many aspects of it...need work to be kind (the dialogue, acting, plotting, etc). It's a fun show for those who like The Bold Type, Ugly Betty, Younger--stuff like that. Nothing about it is realistic, or believable in any way but that's the fun. \n\n**Diagnosis** on Netflix. Some of these patients make me nuts, but it's a fun, very watchable show. It's interesting to see how the psychological side plays such a big part in the patients' overall health.",

I don\u2019t remember where I got the idea that it\u2019s slow at first and that I\u2019d need to be patient through the first couple episodes or so. So I just put it off all that time.\n\n\r  \n**Seven Seconds** on Netflix: A rewatch. One of the best series there imo. It gets progressively sadder though.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI think Netflix just sensed my inclination to European thrillers lol. So the algorithm suggested two series that I\u2019m giving a chance.\r  \n\r  \n The first is **The Twelve**, it\u2019s Belgian and about a woman who is accused of killing her daughter and her best friend. Well, it\u2019s also about the twelve juries (hence the name). And it\u2019s ok so far (third episode). If you feel like you\u2019ve watched all the crime/whodunit shows and been looking for a new one, and don\u2019t mind subtitles (or speak Flemish), then I\u2019d say give it a try.\r  \n\r  \nThe second recommendation from Netflix, in the detective/crime solving genre, was a British show called **Paranoid**. Detectives investigating a public murder crime. It focuses heavily on the detectives' lives. It\u2019s not very gripping to me after two episodes, but I still have it in the background. \n\n\r  \nThinking about watching **Based On A True Story**.",

            "body": "**Silo** - I had high hopes for this post apocalyptic sci-fi drama thanks to it being an adaptation of the Hugh Howey sci-fi novels by Graham Yost of Justified fame. Definitely one of my most anticipated shows of 2023. This ended up really exceeding my expectations and might be my favourite show of the year so far. It had that excellent production quality one now expects from an Apple product and it paired that with a great story and performance from the cast. This was just a great mystery box sci-fi show with perfect pacing. I read that folks found the middle episodes a tad slow but that was not the case for me. I love character building episodes and was addicted to this show from start to finish. Might have helped that I binged rather than watching weekly in that regard! \n\n**The Idol** - What to say that has not already been said? Some of it was mildly entertaining other bits were actively offensive. All of it was pure cringe. I\u2019m going to give them credit and say some of the cringe was clearly intentional\u2026other bits, not so much! Worst thing about it was the fact it was a tad dull! It kept hinting that some fun stuff might happen but none of that actually materialised. Instead it felt like the whole show was an excuse for The Weekend and Sam Levinson to spend all day on set for months with some pretty girls dressed only in thongs. How they managed to make watching a super hot scantily clad cast boring is anybody\u2019s guess? I know Levinson was hauled in to write this on short notice after they axed they previous showrunner and scrips but the dude clearly needed more time to draft an actual story for these 5 episodes. As with all HBO shows it looked a million bucks. To the shows credit the music was also pretty excellent. Say what you want about The Weekend\u2019s acting but this has a great soundtrack. I also felt like The Weekend had improved in acting by the end of the show. The last two episodes had a notable improvement out of him. Outside of The Weekend\u2019s awful acting I also felt this was a career low for Hank Azaria. What was up with that accent? Outside of that I felt like the inexperienced cast actually put in decent performances for the most part. They could all sing and it is not their fault some of the material they had to work with was pure cringe. Poor Suzanna Son in that regard! \n\nMeh..on the whole I did not hate this as much as most but it definitely was not one of HBO\u2019s better outings. I feel like it really should have been a great show and sort of wish we had gotten the Amy Seimetz version as I think that could have been great. That said, if the unlikely happens and this gets a second season I\u2019ll probably give it a chance. I think they can still sort this show in the writing room if the execs clamp The Weekend and shut down his worst ideas. \n\n**Devs** - I\u2019m 4/8 of the way through this Alex Garland limited series. So far so good. Pretty interesting and typical Garland in tone and style. Which is all the more apparent to be me as I started this the night after watching the Men movie from him. \n\nNo idea what is next for me. Maybe I\u2019ll finally jump on board **Snowfall** now that FX has wrapped the series. I always meant to get to it but never did for whatever reason. Probably the perfect time to binge it all!",

The characters, Drax specifically, are fun to watch.\n\nMr. Inbetween. \n\n[Midnight Mass,](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10574558/) dialogue heavy but that's the point, it's very well done.\n\nFleabag, stick with it if you dropped it early.

It's fucking fantastic. So dark, riveting, and great fight choreography for a tv show. It honestly reminds me of Animal Kingdom as well, not just because of the name, but also the tone and they are both about fucked up families in California with all boys.

It seems like some HBO miniseries tend to drift into the void after they air, but I would strongly encourage anyone to give this miniseries a chance. The acting is wonderful, and the show is one of the few that feels literary and captures the same feelings towards characters that you\u2019d experience when reading a book. It\u2019s a bit difficult to explain the plot in a captivating way, as the show spans twenty five years and showcases the life of a married couple, but I would suggest taking a chance on it. Plus, there is little language/sex, if you\u2019re looking for something clean. I highly recommend!",

Is this fall going to just be Big Brother and that real life Hot Wheels show?  Yikes!  I hope not!\n\nLuckily, I have so many fun things to stream!  Like **Based on a True Story** with Kaley Cuoco and that guy who sort of looks like her husband but isn't.  You know how I know this is based on a true story?  Because it's kind of slow and a little dull considering you're pairing two struggling Californians with a serial killing plumber.  That should be wall to wall excitement, but it is not.  And most of the excitement that we do see is not really...real or relevant.  Still, kind of fun.  Not super bingeable because, like I said, moves a little slow, isn't that exciting but it fills an hour a couple of nights a week.\n\n**The Witcher, Season 3** \\- Yeah no.  It's the Witcher but it's not *Witcher* Witcher and it's not as good as the first two (second season especially).  And it's Cavill's last season so I probably won't watch after this.\n\n**The Righteous Gemstones** continues its revival (if you will pardon the evangelistic pun) this season and I feel like we are about to get some serious Judy/BJ and Kelvin Keefe development that is either going to make me pee myself laughing or cry buckets of tears.  Possibly both and that's why this show and this season is so particularly good.\n\n**Expedition Unknown** with Josh Gates has a new season and I'm enjoying it so much, I'm just rewatching previous episodes and seasons.  I'm a big old nerd and I like history and travel and searching for buried treasure.  Even though Gates literally never finds any genuine treasure, his excitement and good nature make the journey fun to watch.  I suppose that's why he's been TV's \"Indiana Jones\" for so long.\n\nTook a long road trip with the girls last weekend to do some ghost hunting, so of course, we watched **Ghost Adventures** with Zac Baggans.  As amateur ghost hunters and women of a certain age, we find this show amusing and entertaining for a couple of reasons.  I used to enjoy **Ghost Hunters** when they were just average plumbers doing the ghost hunting thing as a side gig.  They mostly debunked \"hauntings\" and that it is more accurate to what ghost hunting is - you hear a scary noise and you figure out what made it.  Then you go to Denney's.\n\nOnce in a great, great while we will get something really unexplainable.  Now, I understand how that is not going to sell cars or prescription medication, so television producers need some more excitement, but a giant douche in Ed Hardy jeans screaming that he is possessed is really not doing the ghost hunting community any favors.  Neither are all these shows where the \"investigators\" (*cough*, actors, *cough, cough*) use largely useless gadgets, fake psychics and sometimes, just flat out trickery to get you to watch them wander around a tourist attraction for 42 minutes.  But I still watch it, just like I still watch treasure hunting shows and that is because I enjoy the possibility that something unknown might really be out there.",

It's about a plane that gets hijacked by a band of criminals. \n\nInitially, I dismissed it as it looked quite derivative via the trailers - but I gave it a chance after seeing positive and seeing a few clips which looked promising. And I'm glad I did.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been hooked with a show straight away. It's just a good British show with great high calibre acting and writing.\n\nElba is charismatic as ever, really great in the role as the guy trying to hold everyone together. It also stars a lot of well known actors like Neil Maskell (Utopia), Max Beesley (too many things to name), Ben Miles (The Crown) and Eva Myles (Torchwood).\n\nThe plot is really compelling and feels believable in the way things play out on a character level. There are a few moments where one has to suspend their disbelief but it's just done so well, it pulls you in and you're in for a wild ride.\n\nAnyway, I've seen a lot of people sleeping on this show and dismissing it like I did, so I thought I'd make a post about how great I thought it is. \n\nAnyone else been enjoying it?",

            "body": "**Superman & Lois**\n\nI thought season 3 was really strong overall.  The whole story with >!Lois' cancer!< gave the season a surprising amount of emotional weight, and I thought it was handled really well.  I also really liked the villain's story for most of the season, and how it tied in with what was happening with Lois and Clark.  At first I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the shift in the last couple episode, but I think they pulled it off, and set up a potentially strong final season, at least hopefully.  The announcements of the cast cuts have me a bit concerned (although this episode did set that up for at least a couple characters), but if they do a good enough job continuing the conflict here, I can see it working out well.\n\n**Gotham Knights**\n\nI went into this with a somewhat open mind, to give it a fair chance.  And I will say I probably enjoyed it at least a little bit more than people here generally did, but it was still easily the weakest of the CW DC shows IMO.  Out of the main cast, I'd say Harvey Dent and Duela were my favorites.  If there's one thing I regret about not having a season 2, it's not getting to see more of Misha Colins in full Two-Face mode.  But overall, it didn't stand out enough for me to be bothered by its cancellation, especially if it was between this or Superman & Lois.\n\n**Sonic Prime**\n\nFinished the first season right on time for season 2 next week.  I thought this was a fun take on the Sonic story.  Of course the idea of parallel worlds isn't exactly original at this point, but I thought they handled it well.  You could see that they had fun setting up scenarios, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they come up with next season.\n\nThe characters were pretty well done.  One thing I found interesting was leaning into his cockiness and portraying him as kind of a dick.  But the progression did add some depth to the character journey (although as a whole, the show's still not particularly deep in that respect).  For the other characters, it's interesting getting to know the different versions as we progress through the season.  I'll admit, part of me was hoping they'd make >!evil Amy!< a running gag across all the universes, but it's nice to shake things up, so it doesn't get too repetitive.\n\n**Attack on Titan**\n\nI watched through season 1 while I had Crunchyroll, and it definitely lived up to the hype.  I really liked its take on an apocalyptic world (as a Visual Novel fan, I can easily see the influence of Muv-Luv: Alternative, although I liked the way it still sets itself apart).  The story has a good mix of action, mystery, political world-building, and some character development mixed in (most notably with the main trio).  And the production value is fantastic.  Particularly with the action sequences, you can tell they put everything they had into these sequences.  My favorite was probably in the 5th-to-last episodes of the season, when >!Eren transforms into the Titan after seeing his squad get killed, and has the epic fight with the female Titan.!<  The mystery has been pretty interesting so far as well.  I will say that >!the female Titan looking like Annie!< kind of diminished the surprise of that part, but it still works overall.\n\nIt will be a while before I watch season 2, since I'm canceling my Crunchyroll sub until Spy X Family comes back in October.  But I'm really looking forward to seeing where they go with this story.\n\n**Gundam: Witch From Mercury**\n\nThis was my first experience with the Gundam franchise, and I loved it.  After the major events in the season 1 finale, it was hard to imagine things returning to normal.  I will say that I was unsure during the first episode back, since it did kind of play it safe.  However, things really picked up from there.  The overall plot, character arcs, and world-building got a lot stronger in this season.  I will say that there's one major part of the finale, >!where all the mechs disintegrate!< which screams \"rushed ending,\" which could leave some dissatisfied.  But even with that, I thought it was a great season, and a good way to end the series.\n\n**Hell's Paradise**\n\nA dark shonen anime series about these prisoners who are sent to a mysterious island to look for an elixir of immortality, in exchange for their freedom.  The ideas are pretty interesting, and I really like the way they establish the island's strange nature throughout the season.  The action is well done overall.  I've heard the animation's not quite as strong as some of the company's (MAPPA) other works like Chainsaw Man, though this is the first anime I've seen by them so I can't compare.  The closest anime I've seen to this style would be Attack on Titan, and I'd definitely say AoT is the better produced of the two, although this still is pretty solid overall.  Looking forward to the 2nd season, to see where the story goes.  I will admit I'm a bit weary about the reveal that >!Gabumaru is losing his memory!<, but otherwise I think they did a good job setting up new storylines to explore next season.",

Dropping half of a 10-episode season one month and half the next month to extend subscriptions is just...annoying. Particularly when it's *not* the kind of show that drives new subscriptions. \\[eyeroll\\].\n\nI'm enjoying it, but if you're a Michael Connelly fan expecting *Bosch* feel or crossovers (since Mickey is Bosch's half-brother in the books), this is probably not the show for you. This is a David E. Kelley show, and it feels like a Blue Sky legal drama. S2B will drop 8/3. OTOH, nice for Mickey Haller to actually be half-Mexican in the tv series (like the books) the way Matthew McConaughey decidedly *wasn't* in the movie.\n\nAlso, since [the announcement](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/the-uncanny-counter-counter-punch-season-2-k-drama-coming-to-netflix-in-july-2023/) isn't that easy to find, for my fellow KDrama fans, [***Uncanny Counter 2: Counterpunch***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6VKyXxekRI) will begin dropping on Netflix (and airing on tvN) on July 29th.  So, our favorite demon-hunting/noodle counter tracksuit-wearing superhero team is back.

This season I seem to not be giving a fuck about the going's on and just want them to fuckin' fight already. Inject those sequences into my veins.\n\n**Secret Invasion**: \\[**A+**\\] - I'm a sucker for espionage/spy thrillers and this is great with the \"who is, who isn't\" cast of doubt every episode. Samuel L. Jackson holding it down as always and the de-aging looks great on him. Quickly becoming one of my favorite Marvel shows to date.\n\n**ALONE**: \\[**B**\\] - My favorite parts are shelter construction and then the rest of the seasons are pretty much background fodder for me. Consistent quality television and the only reality show I'll watch.\n\n**The Bureau**: \\[**A**\\] - Finished binging this excellent spy drama this past week and will miss it. Really compelling throughout and mostly avoided the tropes of this genre. However, the series finale kinda felt cobbled together and I didn't agree with some of the decisions.

I want to be able to watch the show, and hear it.  So it would be helpful if Hollywood would actually film stuff that you can see and hear.  \n\nBut maybe it's my TV settings....  but I doubt it.

Great comedy about a group of high school girls from a small town in Ireland set during The Troubles, but it's NOT a teen comedy or any teen genre. It reminds me of Its Always Sunny because of how hilariously horrible the characters can be and some of the dark humor. Sad that it's only 3 short seasons\n\nThe Idol, well I expected this to be a gratuitous, meaningless and tactless fuckfest and I honestly went into it with an open mind and a blank slate, but sadly it met just those expectations. Lots have complained about The Weeknd's acting but I personally didn't find fault with it; the entire thing was cringe, it was definitely not his acting that stood out as cringe. Lilly Depp was pretty great but, maybe this is because I'm a straight girl, the gratuitous nudity and sex really ruined it for me, I'm not a prude but it was almost as if they made the show just to have some girl paraded around like that, rather than to tell a story. So like, if I want to watch softcore porn there are outlets for that and I prefer the source not to be from a quality TV network that I expect will feed me *good stories*. \n\nHonestly I think the ending is what ruined it for me; not wanting to go into spoiler territory, the ending was just very anticlimactic and maybe deux ex?

The acting was fine. The character was supposed to be creepy and cringey. It honestly feels like a lot of people weren't able to separate the character from the actor here (kinda like how people heaped hate upon Anna Gunn cause they hated Skyler White).

Which is too bad because going more in-depth into some characters was good, but putting them into current day earth is just off-putting (I guess they didn't learn that from Picard S2).  Especially when they act so indifferent to time travel which I can understand from audiences who have seen this a million times already, but should have been a mind-blowing Big Fucking Deal to the characters in the show.\n\nEp 4 felt like a carbon copy of half the TOS stories: show up at some random planet where someone from Earth/Starfleet has culturally contaminated things and perhaps even taken over.  Heck even the sets (like the landscape with the mid-size boulders scattered randomly) completely felt like a setting that might have been used from TOS.\n\nHopefully future episodes get their groove back and feeling a bit more like actual sci fi stories in space and with more modern tv-making.",

Not quite as good but still really good: Snabba Cash\n\nAlso think you'd like 12 monkeys, the night of, The Capture, Foundation, Justified, Banshee, Slow Horses, Oz, Devs, Hannibal, and Twin Peaks\n\nEdit: Black Summer if only for the second season (first is very average)",

Also what is the obsession with helicopters exploding? \n\nFubar: so bad it is good for a heartfelt action comedy",
