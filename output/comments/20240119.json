All great Sci fi has relationships at its heart - but usually ones that, as with The Expanse, have consequences extending beyond the personal.\n\nI wish I could get into it tbh, as there's such slim pickings of good Sci fi available and plenty of people really rave about it - but try as I might, I've never managed to get past the middle of S02.",

I\u2019m a fan of the 3 episode documentary format.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Percy Jackson (weekly, Disney+): I\u2019m enjoying this one.

The characters, story, and pacing are all keeping my interest so far.\n\n\u00a0 Physical (just started season 2, Apple): the eating disorder stuff is a bit of a tough watch but I do enjoy the characters and the story. I always like Rose Byrne more than I remember.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The Garden: Commune or Cult (Max): this one and Love Has Won seemed to be taking a pretty liberal definition of cult here. This one I couldn\u2019t figure out if it wanted to be a documentary or a reality show. I did think it was funny the people going out there because they wanted to learn survival skills from these people who were clearly lacking in survival skills.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Death and Other Details (weekly, Hulu): it\u2019s ok so far.

This show is weird because it feels like a lot happens every episode while simultaneously nothing really happening.

I'd watch the afternoon TV cartoons, then I'd watch reruns of *The Twilight Zone*, *I Love Lucy*, *Three's Company*, and over time, I started watching *M.A.S.H.* reruns, which aired a bit later. I think two episodes were sandwiched between the evening news. At first I just found things like Radar's name funny and laughed at some of the gags. Later on, I actually kind of got teary-eyed over the more serious episodes. \n\nI still remember when the *M.A.S.H*. finale aired on CBS as that was major event. I still was fairly young so I didn't understand all the themes of the show, but even though I was still a child, I still watched that finale. It seemed like everyone in the US was watching it at the time. \n\nWhen I later became an adult, I used to think filling my mind with so much TV was such a waste, but it did bond people, acting as a shared experience that everyone could relate to at the time.  Also, in particular with *M.A.S.H*., it was nice to see Asians on the screen, as my father also came from an war-torn Asian country, and I could get sort of an appreciation for the hardship he went through, as much as my child's mind could allow, before he later immigrated to the US. \n\nAs for watching old favorites, not quite as old, but I've been enjoying *Northern Exposure*, which is finally available for streaming now on Amazon Prime.",

I doubt it will be renewed, but if it gets a second season, I don't intend to watch. Honest. Not even the first episode... Who am I kidding, I'll probably watch it and hate the second season, too. \n\n**Stargate: Universe**, a rewatch of one of my favorite shows! I like all the Stargate series, but Universe is my favorite of them all. So deliciously dark, all the characters are realistically grey, no black/white clear bad guys/good guys. \n\nLast week someone mentioned **Son of a Critch**, a Canadian comedy. I'm really enjoying my slow watch of that.\n\n**Percy Jackson** is my only weekly live show I'm following. It's fine, but I'm finding that I'm watching more for the adult characters than the three kids. Ares and Hermes were great, I'd love to see a show about them.",

One of the problems I have with it though is I hate the will they won't they trope in TV shows and this show is basically that so I found it a bit annoying at times however the 2 leads are great and their chemistry is unmatched also I've watched a lot of shows in my lifetime and very few characters have made my blood boil more than the brother of Marianne which says a lot.\n\n7.5/10",

Stay that way if you can.\n\nAlso, if you like Nicola Walker, [*Annika*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogaGW3E9WA) is a tv adaptation of Nick Walker (no relation)'s long running BBC 4 radio series, [*Annika Stranded*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b049fg98/episodes/player)*.* The BBC Sounds app and the BBC website lets you listen to BBC radio worldwide.\n\n>Started Funny Woman, ...\n\nI got about 2/3 of the way through the first episode and noped out.

PBS *Masterpiece* has also picked up the sequel series, *The Moonflower Murders.*\n* *River* ([Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/River-Season-1/dp/B0C8WPPKHJ)).

Russell T. Davies doing his thing.

It's a seasonal anthology where only the main detective character is the same (played by Tcheky Karyo). But you may have to settle for [*The Tourist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIjbxpFvAzs) \\[Netflix soon+S2, Max dropped it after S1\\], or [*The Widow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M) \\[Amazon Prime\\] which aren't as good.

But [*The Honourable Woman*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg3Yzfu5kYI) isn't on any streaming sub I can find.\n* [*The Capture*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSSmitzvmUU) \\[Peacock\\]. Not as strong as these other shows, but pretty good, positing the question of video evidence in a world where deepfaking exists. Also has Ron Perlman in it.\n* [*Vigil*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XRW0kfI2As) \\[Peacock\\]. Also not as strong as the others, but showrun/created by Tom Edge who did a couple of the *\\[C.B.\\] Strike* adaptations. But S1 is a murder on a navy submarine.

I'm starting to see her own particular brand of storytelling, a unique mix of mystery, horror and character development.\n\n**Fargo S5 Finale (Hulu)** \\-- An end to a really great season. I loved how the finale takes a surprising turn, ending the season as it began: with a heavy dose of Minnesota kindness, but this time, it was true kindness, an inverse of the brawl that began the season. I love Fargo S1 and S2, but I think S5 had one of the most satisfying finales.  Juno Temple was terrific throughout this season, but Sam Spruell as Ole Munch might be one of my favorite characters ever.

I liked it, but it's not up there with my *absolute* favourites. MM's character, Rust, was excellent - but his 'philosophy' was all stuff I've spent plenty of time getting into anyway , so I wonder if that familiarity meant it had less of an impact on me than it might for some viewers? Anyway, I enjoyed it enough that I'm planning on watching S02 and S03 even though plenty of people have panned them. I've watched S02E01 and quite like it so far. Interestingly, S03 actually received really good reviews, even though it didn't attract so many viewers.\n\n**Ted**\n\nAfter binging True Detective I needed something lighter, and I finished the excellent **The Brothers Sun** last week. It's great timing to have Ted fall in my lap then. It's very watchable, very stupid, and just what I need.\n\n**Echo (Marvel)**\n\nI'm on episode three of five, so I'll probably finish it. It's really not very good though. I'm not going to list all the reasons why - the critics have all already done that. Just to say - they're right.\n\n**Percy Jackson and the Olympians**\n\nThree episodes in, I'm now waiting until all eight are broadcast so I can watch the rest back to back when I want. Fabulously escapist stuff.\n\n**SurrealEstate**\n\nI'm getting towards the end of S02. Such an unusual show. I'm amazed it's been made - the pitch must have just sounded ridiculous. Try describing it to someone who's never heard of it, and see what look they give you at the end. They may be concerned for your welfare and wonder if you got your synapse trapped in the microwave door. It's so well done though, the different elements and pacing are skilfully balanced to perfection, and the acting is just the right mix of taking it seriously and tongue-in-cheek. I really hope they get a third season (and more).\n\n**Sanctuary: A Witch's Tale**\n\nS01E01was okay, but E02 was definitely much better. Having established that I want to watch it then, I'm waiting until they've broadcast all seven before I dive into the rest. It just seems better suited to watching them back to back.\n\n**12 Monkeys**\n\nI'm not one for rewatching shows usually. But in the absence of any decent sci-fi on the small screen at the moment, I've returned to S01 of one of my very favourite shows of all time. S01's good, and I'm enjoying it - but if I recall correctly it really picks up once it's found its feet a bit.",

Fantastic.\n\nBinged **Echo** over the weekend.  It's ok, but had the potential to be so much more.  Part of the problem is the lacklustre finale because it is kind of an in-between series and so could not have a satisfying resolution.  It also suffers from having the Marvel formula of direct confrontations/fight scenes which release the built-up tension...but then either the tension is released and gone and needs to be built up again or else the encounter is unsatisfying because it didn't resolve much.  This show seemed to suffer from both of that.  The encounters were both unsatisfying and the show didn't have enough time to really build up the tension again before the finale, so it is underwhelming.\n\n**Night Country Ep2** - I'm liking it but I do have some bias because I like Jodie Foster, and I am a sucker for this kind of genre (slow burn mystery drama, especially if it has some supernatural element of some kind whether it turns out to be real or not).  Feelings on this show seem very mixed though and I can understand that since True Detective tends to have such flawed protagonists which makes it tricky to make them liked/understood by the audience, and I feel Foster's character may not be relatable to much of the audience (younger and male so the challenges she is facing are more alien) and also the issues facing the other female characters (being a minority rarely portrayed on TV).\n\nCurrent \"background show\" for while I am working and just catch parts of it as it goes: X-Files S1.  I've seen this show so many times that it feels like an old pair of boots that are just so comfy.  Some of the chiils still come through and but it's really the chemistry of the main characters that I love.",

            "body": "**True Detective Season 1** on HBOMAX. Finished whole season. I watched Season 4: 1 and liked it, and noted in a comment that I noped out of Season 1 about 20 minutes into it and explained why. A couple people questioned my judgement so I decided to watch the entire thing and see if I was correct. I was...partly. The first two episodes *do* spend time talking about the ritual of murder, the camera all but caressing a dead (and violated) body of the female victim, having the detectives talk about the religious aspects of the murder--all the things I found repellent and off putting the first time. I'm on Marty's side: shut UP Rust.\n\nHowever, having now watched the whole thing I have opinions that are now well-founded. \n\nIt's very well done. It was highly watchable. There were many exceptional aspects to it, including the cinematography, sense of place, acting, and plot. Is it a \"masterpiece\" or the single best season of tv ever, etc? To me...no. But I'm not a man, and not in my 20s and not an Atheist or an edgelord. There's a **lot** of themes that will resonate with men much more than women I suspect. \n\nOne thing that really ground my gears: every single female love interest was just this side of \"sexy lamp\". They did things in a way that *very* few real women would. It also angered me deeply when the victim of trafficking (basically) met Marty at 15, he tries to save her, and then when they meet as an adult, she's *obviously* deeply damaged from her years as a pro. But he goes on to have a physical affair with her where she acts like a blow up doll stripper fantasy girl (this also irritated the hell out of me) and she's easily 20 years his junior. Also someone she *trusted* and supposedly the only man who ever gave a damn about her. Nice work Marty. That really made my skin crawl.\n\nAside from that I have questions. So the main Big Bad that they find in the 2000s after the first Big Bad, is he...slow? If he is, how is he the mastermind behind the lack of fingerprints and baffling case in the 90s and the case the detectives who are interviewing Marty and Rust can't solve? Or is that the Tuttle group? If he isn't slow, why is he with his half sister (or whoever) who is at the very least, mentally compromised? Some of the dialogue makes it clear that they have the mentality and vocabulary of children! How did this slow/totally batshit guy develop a cult and build all those super-complex altars? How did he evade capture this whole time? Is he the \"yellow king\" or is that an entity that Errol also worships (as hinted by Betty)? Or am I overthinking it and it's all vibes no plot at the end?\n\nAnyway, is it terrific? Yes. Does it have some (in my mind) pretty serious flaws? Also yes. \n\n**American Nightmare** on Netflix. Holy CRAP. I feel for this woman. What a true horror. A bizarre story with many twists and turns and a satisfying ending. A tiny bit dragged out and suffers from some self-important subjects like all Netflix docs, but worth your time.\n\n**Will and Grace** sort-of rewatch--I recall seeing this during its original run and I'm watching it on streaming now, dipping in and out of the seasons. It's light and cute, and laugh out loud funny, if a tad dated in places.",

Nope.  \n\nIts stupid men doing stupid things and only on TV do they get big hero moments that make it all okay.  In real life your family just fucking hates you and you die alone.  \n\nI don't think Nick Pizalato the writer of Seasons 1-3 gets it.

Season 2 lagged a bit for me in the middle but it really ended on a high and the season(s) are thankfully don't overstay their welcome with 8 episodes. I wasn't a Chucky fan coming into this show but it's been great and does a good job of satisfying new and old viewers of the franchise.\n\n**The Curse** \\- Boy Howdy that was an ending. I kept saying to people during it's run I had no idea where the show was headed and I wasn't wrong, no one did. I wasn't expecting an uplifting ending, but we got one. well worth your time to watch over a couple of weeks. I wouldn't binge watch.\n\n**Fargo -** First half of the last episode felt rushed and fairly unsatisfying. Last 15 minutes was riveting. Great season. I've not watched another of the others so I've started S2 and I love how different it feels. \n\n**Love After Lockup** \\- Don't see many reality shows here, especially trash ones but LALU is a real guilty pleasure. It's about folks who fall in love with an inmate and when released try to be together, often times it's the people on the outside that are the damaged and delusional ones. I wasn't expecting a cast member this season to be found out to be cheating on his wife with a man, but that's what happened. Love this franchise and it's spin-offs.\n\n**Reacher** \\- Got half way through season 2 and gave up. I'll watch it in the background now that it's finished. His friends and the season storyline really wasn't doing much for me. Bring back wandering Reacher in a strange land please.\n\n**True Detective (latest one)** \\- First episode was good. Not sure if I'm sold on the apparent sci-fi stuff. But it's early days. Looking forward to the rest",

The psychological themes really resonated with me and the horror sequences in the second part of the show were really well done. The show also has a lot of interesting and fleshed out characters. Nearly all of them are pathetic or despicable in some way, but they\u2019re also very human and sympathetic. The show also has some really stunning art direction and visuals, despite the time limitations the team was under.\n\nOne complaint I have is not with the show itself, but its localization into English. The Netflix sub is serviceable but felt too stilted in its translation, and the Netflix dub was even worse in that regard. The original 1996 English dub does more localization and is hammy at times (especially early on), but the voice actors give very characterful performances in contrast to the more professional-yet-boilerplate performances of the Netflix cast. I wanted to watch the 1996 dub to get the experience older fans of the series had, and it was frustratingly difficult to find.\n\nWhile the ending does wrap up the main themes of the series pretty succinctly, it basically leaves the plot itself hanging. I\u2019ve heard the *End of Evangelion* movie addresses this, though, so I\u2019ll reserve my judgement on that front.",

The humor is hit or miss - not as 'grounded' or as funny as Monty Python could be where those guys REALLY knew their history.\n\nWhat I really, really liked about this show was the underlying ANGER of it - the exasperation about the various ways people self sabotage themselves for all sorts of reasons: greed, ambition, fear, resentment, weakness, lust, love. It really is pretty 'wise' in this respect. \n\nWhat is great is how the characters happily accept the societal roles that  effectively enslave them. The main characters despise the idea of women having equal rights, the servants embrace living only to make their masters happy. Gay men are content to live in the closet. \n\nI never got into watching any of those 'lifestyles of the rich and famous' reality shows like the Kardashian ones, so was not really that amused by the running subplot of one of the sister's desperation to be a star. I did like that the other sister was like a closet genius but kept that under wraps to stay close to the love of her life (her brother).\n\nOne thing I really liked because it was to totally off the wall was that the head butler was raised by indians - which they don't hit you over the head with but sort of a running thing that gets brought up occasionally. There are 'drop ins' of various people who were famous in or around that time that as far as I could tell were usually quite historically inaccurate but that seemed to be part of the joke.\n\nANYWAY - its sad the show was cancelled and they didn't seem to get an opportunity to tie up all the loose ends.",

It's fascinating.  It's 10x35-minute episodes. The documentary covers the world of superhot peppers by following individual competition eaters and growers. The approach is respectful and as quirky, and full-bore as the world they're covering \\[note: the TV-MA is probably for the on-camera vomiting\\]. And getting Ben Schwarz to do the voiceovers was a stroke of *genius*. You've probably never heard a documentary voiceover by Dewey Duck before. :D",

            "body": "Watched the first episode of ***True Detective: Night Country*** **(Max)** and loved it. I'm in for the season. I also have to mention here, that *True Detective* is **not** a show I've followed/loved. I only made it through S1 when it aired and when we got to >!girl-impaled-on-antlers!< all I could think was *Hannibal*\\-wannabe. I bounced off S2 in about 20 minutes.  I'm a woman and shows I'll mentally tag as \"overt testosterone\" viewing tend to put me off.  :D\n\nThis series? Is very female-centric with both a female showrunner and a female producer and two female leads. Also this is **a different showrunner** ([Issa L\u00f3pez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0411517/)) from the OG series ([Nic Pizzolatto](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4446305)). So while it's reminiscent in tone (i.e., darker detective procedural) and it's definitely in the same vein, this isn't exactly Season 4 of *True Detective* in the way you might expect. YMMV from mine, depending on how much you wanted more of the same.\n\nI also really liked [the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77NHdjQQ5Y), ymmv.  And why the HELL has none of the promotional material mentioned that Fiona FREAKING Shaw is in this?!! (I know you lot probably remember her more from *Andor* and *Killing Eve,* but I've know who she was since her RSC days in the '80s (and being in shows like [*Sherlock Holmes*](https://youtu.be/JUdrx91RraE?si=A5EfWVrCDv7JXTpt&t=429))*,* and most recently for me, she absolutely killed it in [*Baptiste* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoy5vz0yN_Y)).\n\nNoped out on ***Belgravia: The Next Chapter*** (MGM+) about 10 minutes in. The lack of Julian Fellowes writing is self-evident.\n\n[***Monsieur Spade***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUt7j_eXWOo) (AMC/AMC+/AcornTV+/Sundance Now) got off to a solid start. I'm definitely in for this one. Clive Owens makes a good retired Sam Spade in the south of France in the '60s. It's deliberately paced, though, so if you need slambam action may not be for you. The showrunners are Scott Frank *(The Queen's Gambit)* and Tom Fontana *(Oz).*\n\n***Bluey S3C*** (Disney+) has landed. At last, we Yanks can watch \"Cricket\". :D I also note, the heaviest edit is probably [the excision of the first scene of \"Exercise\".](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/scene-cut-bluey-episode-exercise-complaints-body-image-fat-shaming)\n\nOff to check out ***Hazbin Hotel*** (Amazon Prime). [First episode's up on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOYEFe1FsCI). \\[Update\\] I'm back. I'm in. I never saw the youtube pilot, so I was slightly taken aback (given the 16+ rating) at the prolific use of profanity and mentions of porn, drugs, kink, etc. in this A24 animated musical about Hell, but I'm okay now.  Also, they have Keith David *singing*. Something *Gargoyles* never managed to do. :D Initial 4-episode drop, then 2/week for the final four.\n\nUpcoming for me (links to youtube trailers):\n\n* 1/21.

Guest, Calista Flockhart is Lee Radziwill, and Treat Williams is Bill Paley.\n* 2/1. [*The Tourist* S1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIjbxpFvAzs) drops on Netflix \\[dumped from HBO Max\\] in anticipation of S2 dropping on 2/29. Williams Bros.

[*Mr. and Mrs. Smith*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsaMWxppznk) \\[Amazon Prime\\] More rebooting the Scott Bakula/Maria Bello 1996 tv series than the Brangelina flick.\n* 2/11.

Guy Ritchie and [Matthew Read](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0713852/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) showrun.\n* 3/3.

Like he was excellent and maybe even perfect, don't get me wrong I loved every bit of his performance. I just feel like his look locked him in this role, because it also does fit perfectly. I just feel like he's such a good actor and he has good range so maybe those 2 dimensional characters are a bit under his level? Like he could be doing something more interesting while somebody else would do Roy Tillman. It's the only negative(?) thing I have to say about this show. I haven't anticipated the next episodes of a show like this in a while, even more than Last Of Us. Anyway tell me how you feel and don't go easy on me.\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nAlso one show I started watching that has really surprised me is Day Break(2006), Ground hog day meets the police investigation thriller, basically. Actors are good enough, story is interesting, it's not a twist after twist for the sake of a twist-fest, easy binge. Also it features Mike dude from Breaking bad in the same role, like you think Vince Gilligan was a genius finding him, but actually he was already doing that role a year before lol and probably even before that since he was in so much tv before. Anyway go watch that show if you're looking for a light mystery/action/thriller.",
