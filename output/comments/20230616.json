The performances are great across the board and it's a beautiful story (even if they do walk across the island an eye-rolling number of times). \n\nThe sixth season is still kind of a weird jump, especially the temple stuff at the start of the season, but it's connecting better than I remember it did during the original watch 13 years ago. Will update when I finish the final episode later this afternoon.\n\nEDIT: Just finished it and the ending worked well. I interpreted it a lot differently this time than I did originally. There weren't as many loose threads as I thought there was when I first watched it. Definitely a great ride and one of TV's best shows.\n\nEDIT #2: Just learned that there is [an epilogue to the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjPzV2RvO8) that gives answers to some of the questions that weren't addressed.",

Now that it's 25 years later? Their circumstances are even tougher. Nobody got out, as it were. Simon Beaufoy (who wrote the movie) and Alice Nutter have expanded the storytelling with some new characters in very strong ways (while still concentrating on the core characters) so this doesn't have that stretched-out-feature-film feel so many streaming series do.

As expected Lizzy Caplan and Joshua Jackson were fantastic in the lead roles. The story was solid but not super exciting. Very watchable but not particularly memorable if you know what I mean? I did quite like the fact this was not just a straight retelling of the movie. I also really liked most of the ending\u2026with the exception of that last scene twist! \n\n**Bloodhounds** - This had some top notch action scenes and seems to be well thought of by most viewers but I\u2019ll admit that there were times where this one really struggled to keep me engaged. I liked the early episodes but it lost me a bit as the series progressed. \n\n**The Ark** - I\u2019m about 2/3 of the way through this one but have to admit I\u2019m really enjoying it. I love this type of sci-fi nonsense. When you guys ask who is watching shows like The Ark, Pandora, Another Life, Krypton, Killjoys, and Dark Matter the answer is me! I love this stuff even if it is absolute soapy nonsense wrapped in a sci-fi package! \n\nNext up for me will be **City on Fire** and **Saint X**.",

Like just so fake and plastic and sit-com-y. I felt that same way about Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and The Good Place as well as Crazy Ex Girlfriend. It was like being in a live action Target commercial or something--too high energy, and too bright and \"zany\". It got a few laughs out of me but I'm not sure I'll continue.\n\n**From** on Prime. Very mixed reaction. On one hand, terrific and interesting plotline and set up. On the other, I couldn't care less about every single character. They all rub me the wrong way in different ways except maybe Donna and Father Khatri. Trip and fall into that cellar, Ethan. And don't come back. \n\n**Silo** blew through all the episodes up to this week's, read Wool, just want more. Wool had about 50-100 pages too much of pure action/fighting and interestingly, lacked some of the character and relationship depth of the show, something that almost never happens, but it was super good. To me the effectiveness of the show isn't the mystery per se, it's fairly easy to guess at the big reveals, it's more the speculative nature of the story and the world-building that make it so good. \n\n**Anna Nicole: You Don't Know Me** on Netflix. Eh, solid. Not much we didn't already know about her, and felt a tiny bit grimy and exploitive at times. She had a really tragic life in many ways, but something about her manner makes her very difficult to sympathize with for me personally. I think she 100% lost track of the truth by about age 21 or so and coasted along on a riverbed of self-serving lies and deception until her untimely end. The most striking (and very telling) image is of her greeting her long lost father wearing her hair in pigtails in her late 20's or perhaps even early 30s (oof, girl) and using a sexy baby voice to talk to him, like she would a lover. Red flag city in terms of arrested development and issues.",

Not amazing, but still kind of charming and makes for a nice prequel/spinoff to the original IJ trilogy.

Man, Christian Cooper is high-energy! :)  And I loved the line about \"you think I'm Indiana Jones, don't you?\" as his guide leads him onto the suspension bridge in the jungle to find him another life bird. My only quibble is that they're not stopping to define what a life bird is for the non-birders. OTOH, *are* non-birders going to watch this? :D \n\n***The Full Monty*** (Hulu). Finished it and I was not disappointed. Loved it. YMMV vary, depending on how you remember the movie and how comedic you're expecting things to get. To me, this is more similar to a dramedy like *Last Tango in Halifax* (which I also loved. Sally Wainwright doesn't just write *Happy Valley).* \n\n***Happy Valley S3*** (BBC America, AMC+, AcornTV). Holy shit, this show is good. And Wainwright's going to give me a heart attack. \n\n***With Love S2*** (Amazon Prime). Finally got around to finishing up Season 2, as I was finally in the right mood for it. Enjoyed it as much as S1 once I got to the right place for it.  If you liked Gloria Calderon Kellett's *One Day a Time* Latinx reboot, this is her next show, it's a Latinx Romcom+family dramedy.  She's also given herself the best lines as Tia Gladys. :)\n\n***Endeavour S9*** (PBS *Masterpiece*) *Endeavour* begins its swan song. If you've been into the franchise from the start, PBS has also got an ITV look back called *Morse & the Last Endeavour. Lewis* is barely covered. :D Gotta admit, I'm gonna miss the chance to see Anton Lesser and Roger Allam doing their thing on a regular basis. Still cracks me up they were both in GoT (as Qyburn and Illyrio, respectively), when I can remember seeing Lesser's Richard III and Allam as the Duke in *Measure for Measure* back in the RSC at the Barbican days...\n\n***The Wonder Years S2*** (ABC). Feels like it's been a while since S1 was a fall show. Still a nice update over the OG show, and Saladin K. Patterson combined with Dule Hill as the dad is bringing that *Psych* vibe in. Pretty much holding steady from s1.\n\n***Class of '09*** (Hulu). Still going strong for me. I get it's not going to work for anyone looking for a more typical SF/cop/action show.  But I've watched Tom Rob Smith's BBC2 shows (*MotherFatherSon, London Spy*) as well as ACS: *The Assassination of Gianni Versace.* And to me the time period hopping is very specifically for a UK writer to examine and critique the US criminal system's prejudices, and to show how they're rooted (past), why someone might be tempted to try and use AI to remove them and the decision they'd make (present) that could lead to it going horribly wrong (future). \n\nMostly, now, just waiting for ***Secret Invasion*** to hit Disney+ on Wednesday. :D",

I would have preferred more sci in this sci-fi but ok, from the comments here I thought it was a lot worse. I just hope that the story will be not so predictable like it seems to be at third episode (like I have the impression that the bad bous are those guys from \"inquisition\" and the new major, they killed the old major and that their reason are the usual \"we must keep the order\" and I guess the people sent to clean had poisoned gas in the helmet etc. I hope it will be something more original)\n\nLast thing, but it's me or Rebecca Ferguson here is really bad?

Smithereens (EP2): This one has the highest IMDB rating but I think it's melancholic and the kidnapper's motives are pretty naive and unlikely.\n\nI'm starting S6 and will see how it goes.",

It seems like Charlie Booker has had enough of technological horror and futuristic angst and wanted to pursue different directions, however this was done in majority very badly.\n\n- **Joan is awful** - In general I liked it. In all honesty, this is the only episode of this season that I actually liked. It is creepy, funny, sad. The legal parts are, even for someone like me who knows completely nothing about American legal system, completely unbelievable but the story is decent enough that I was able to ignore it and continue enjoying it.  \n- **Loch Henry** - and we're starting with episodes that don't really feel like Black Mirror at all. Here and in Joan is awful the hole Streamberry feels very masturbatory for Netflix but the biggest flaw of this episode is that it is mostly boring. It could've been easily made better but throughout the whole episode there isn't really any tension and they just go in your face with the big reveal in the end but the way it is executed feels worse than the worst of Shayamalan excesses.\n- **Beyond the Sea** -  we're back in Black Mirrorish episodes but this is by far the absolute worst piece of crap. It is also simply fucking stupid episode >!the whole schtick works because we have 2 astronoauts in some deep space mission and they have android bodies on Earth. There's no lag, connection is perfect, they can spend VAST MAJORITY of their time on Earth with their families as mission is going on its own. THEN WHY THE FUCK DID THEY SEND REAL HUMANS IN SPACE INSTEAD OF ROBOT BODIES? THEY COULD'VE JUST SEND THE DAMN ROBOTS IF THERE'S NO CONNECTIVITY ISSUES! Of course, this is this way because otherwise the plot would not work at all. And don't even get me started on the ending cause it is worse than Loch Henry!<\n- **Maisy Day** - it is fun and entertaining enough. I wasn't bored like in Loch Henry and in Beyond the Sea but there's nothing Black Mirror about it really. It is just extremally simplistic >!werewolf!< story and that's it.\n- **Demon 79** - also doesn't really feel at all like Black Mirror. Also pretty bad. A sad non-white grey mouse finds >!magic stone with demon inside!< and goes on murder-spree. There's nothing in this episode other than trying to force in your throats message \"white people are bad and racist m'kay?\". \n\nOverall, fuck this shit. This was really bad.",

            "body": "**The Flash**\n\nI agree with those who say this show is one of the bigger examples of the Arrowverse shows suffering as they aged, and the final season was no different.  Though I will admit the season had its ups and downs, and while the main arcs weren't the greatest, it could be fun at times.  I do still think Grant Gustin was great in the role, and it was mostly the writing that let this Flash down.\n\n**Teen Titans season 2**\n\nI really liked this season overall.  Terra was a really interesting character.  I liked seeing her relationship with the others evolve, especially with Beast Boy.  And the main conflict with >!Slade!< was really well done, especially in the last couple episodes.\n\nFor the stand-alone episodes, I thought the lighter ones weren't quite as good as season 1, but were still fun.  The best ones IMO were \"How Long is Forever?\" and \"Fear Itself.\"\n\n**South Park season 3**\n\nI recently got back to my rewatch of these early seasons, and while I did enjoy the fist couple seasons, this is definitely where it started to pick up a bit in quality IMO.  The writing style gets sharper, and this was where the political and social satire started to get a bit more pointed (though obviously not as much as later seasons).\n\nA few of the stand-outs for me were \"Rainforest Schmainforest,\" Sexual Harassment Panda,\" the whole meteor show trilogy, \"Chinpokomon,\" \"Starvin' Marvin in Space\" (better than I remembered), and \"The Red Badge of Gayness.\"\n\n**Aokana**\n\nAn anime adaptation of a Visual Novel I really like.  On one hand, it does a good job capturing the base personalities of the main girls, and it's great seeing the animated sequences for the sports action.  On the other hand, shifting the focus away from the main character, and the bonds he develops with the girls does get rid of a fair amount of the depth from the main story.  There's still *some* depth to his character, most notably his relationship to his mentor Aoi, but even then it kind of pales in comparison to the original story.  Overall, I did still like the anime in its own way, even if  I thought the Visual Novel was better.",
