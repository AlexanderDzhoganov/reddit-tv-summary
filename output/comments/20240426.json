On Max , and it must be an hbo or Cinemax show because there\u2019s a good bit of sex in it.\n\nFallout \u2014 never played the games really, but having been involved in video game culture for 26 years you pick up on some stuff on the bigger franchises. It\u2019s definitely a binge worthy show, just fun sci fi adventure really. I\u2019m almost done with it and glad to hear it\u2019s been renewed for season 2 already. 8/10\n\nShogun \u2014 I\u2019ve already finished it, but I\u2019m rewatching certain episodes just to verify some stuff/go over some of the conversations that were had. This is one of the better shows I\u2019ve seen in awhile, it\u2019s like early seasons of GoT good with the political intrigue going on, except samurai-era Japan. 9/10",

Actually enjoying it more upon rewatch, acting is great and the writing is solid too. It\u2019s certainly different from GOT in that I don\u2019t really love any of the characters specifically, but they all feel realistic to the setting and once they hit the time jump things get wild very quickly",

I've never played LoL, but enjoyed the show thoroughly. The animation was top notch\u00a0\n* **Spy Family** (comedy/family/a bit of action) - there's a family. The dad is a secret spy. The mom is an assassin and the daughter is a telepath, but each of them keep their true identity secret from the rest of the family. It's a fun wholesome and entertaining show\n* **Cyberpunk**: Edge Runners (action/adventure/sci-fi) - in the future where\u00a0 corporations run everything, hackers try their best to not get caught and gangs do odd jobs to get their share, tells the story of a guy who gets caught in the middle of everything\u00a0\n* **Mob Psycho 100** (action/comedy) - just watch 3-4 episodes trust me: you'll be hooked. It's about a kid who has really strong psychic powers and does his best to contain them. He gets hired to use his powers to exorcise demons and ghosts while trying to keep a healthy social life at school\n* **Vinland Saga** (action/drama) - this is quite a journey about a Viking boy that leaves his village and venture into the world\n* **Frieren** (fantasy) - I haven't watched this one yet, but it's next on my list. It's a great fantasy anime (think lord of the rings) that was in the top charts for the last few months. The first season ended not too long ago",

BUT I want to stress this is overall a very minor criticism and there's a lot of helpful explainers on the internet that got me through it. The story, performances, and overall product of the show is top notch. One of the best of the year so far, imo.\n\nBinged **Baby Reindeer** this weekend and thought it was great. It is a bit dark/depressing but also had some very funny moments. The intermingling of different thematic ideas is genuinely interesting--victimhood/victimization, authenticity vs. deceptive/performative fabrication/self-aggrandizement, etc. It's all the more fascinating because it's based on a true story and, from what I've read, it sounds like most of the show really is pretty close to what happened in real life, at least in the broad strokes. Kind of a heavy show--there's lots of trauma and I really just felt very sad for basically everyone--but it's a quick binge (7 eps, about 30-35 min each). Definitely a difficult watch at times.

Like part of the problem for the Emperor's heir is he only had one boy with a concubine.\u00a0\n\n\nYeah it doesn't really explain everything like you're supposed to be the English guys perspective not knowing Japanese culture/society that well. So his misunderstanding/not fully comprehending who this guy or this woman is and what relationship stuff is going on is part of the Show.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not so familiar with Japanese history at least this time period of it but they are throwing in real historical events/characters. Like I knew what they meant by the \"Black Ship\" that is a real Portuguese Ship that started introducing Flintlock Rifles and Cannons to Japan.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually what Japan is going to do is ban all Foreigners/foreign trade and it'll work for a while until about the 1850s when United States sends a full Metal Warship with way more modern Guns into their port and Japan realizes the rest of the World kept technologically advancing in warfare.

                    "body": "So the first thing that comes to mind is **OJ: Made in America**, which is another fantastic ESPN documentary series that came out a few years before The Last Dance.  If you have not seen this, I would start here first.\n\nOtherwise, honestly there are not a ton of great options, and that is simply because most sports footage is owned by ESPN and/or the leagues themselves.  Fortunately, ESPN has put out a number of documentaries under their \"**30 for 30**\" banner like The Last Dance and OJ: Made in America.\n\nThere are over 100 **30 for 30** titles, and I have loved almost everyone I have seen.  So I would just pick one or two that interest you and start there.  ESPN recently started licensing a handful of 30 for 30 docs to Netflix, so you can find some on Netflix, including **OJ: Made in America**.  Two others I highly recommend are **The Fab Five** and **I Hate Christian Laetner**.\n\nI believe most of the rest of the 30 for 30 catalog is on Disney Plus, or ESPN+ (or both, I forget).  Some of my favorites are:  \n**Catching Hell** - directed by Alex Gibney, which is about the Chicago Cubs fan who tried to catch the home run ball that changed the entire outcome of the baseball playoffs series.  \n**No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson** - directed by the legendary Steve James\n\nSome other good ones: **Once Upon a Time in Queens** (4 parts)**, The Life and Trials of Oscar Pistorius** (4 parts), **The American Gladiators Documentary** (2 Parts)***,*** **The Luckiest Guy in the World** (2 Parts)**, Four Days in October, The U,** **Pony Excess**, **The Rand**, **Doc & Daryl** (directed by Judd Apatow), and **Long Gone Summer**.\n\nNetflix has tried to get a foot in the sports documentary genre with their series of **Untold** documentaries, which focuses on some of the more non-traditional sports stories. While they are not quite on the same level of the 30 for 30 documentaries, some are really good. For example, **Untold: Malice at the Palice** about the Ron Artest fight with fans in the stands.",

Drags on in certain subplots, but maintains a decent pace overall with things happening all the time. Overall a definite favorite.\n\n**Halo** season 1 at least. Was a very bland for me. Enjoyed some fun sequences, but the story seemed very meh. I never played the game so I don\u2019t know what the story is supposed to be other than big badass guy, but he and his story weren\u2019t nearly as impressive. I hear season 2 is better, but I\u2019m on the fence. \n\n**Silo**: never read the book, but enjoyed the setting and world. The slow unraveling of a mystery and interactions between everyone. I\u2019m looking forward to season 2.\n\n**Hijack** meh for me. Found it well shot, and decent pace for me. However, a bit mediocre for me overall.\n\n**Fallout** Really enjoyed it. I was only familiar with the opening scene of Fallout from YouTube and enjoyed it in the show as well. I enjoyed it a lot more than most other video game adaptations even like the Last of Us, which I saw last year and thought was good. However, by the end I was a bit sick of \u201cevery episode exploring a different thing\u201d feeling which I thought must be a limitation of a video game adaptation. After in that\u2019s probably what you want in a video game. Fallout seemed to handle much better for me with tying all the stories together. The only episode that was like that was the other Vault they ran into. But even that gave a back story for the monster they met earlier and Shady Sands escapees and felt connected to their story more than just running into some random isolated cannibals or a random group or couple here and there. \n\n**Baby Reindeer\u201d binged that one on Saturday. It was dark and sad and a great show.\n\n**The Leftovers** bleh. Not for me for sure.\n\n**The Bear** Great show over all. Loved getting sucked in the mindset of a highly competitive cook trying to operate on another level and pull everyone up with him despite his own struggles. \n\n**3 Body Problem** loved the story, and promise. Hated most of the cast except for a couple of them. Wished they made the world a bit bigger to match the stakes. Will watch season 2 when it comes out.\n\n**Invincible** one of my all time favorite shows. Not much to say other than top tier for me.\n\nOpen for suggestions.",

I loved most of the performances, the cinematography, the writing. It was great. I do have a few nitpicks though.. \n\nAs good as the show looks it tends to look a bit Soft at times. This is more an issue with Fx and budget I presume, but there are tons of shots that should look amazing but they're blurred around the edges , soft looking, or focused on only part of the overall set. It reminds me of AHS style filming which leads me to think it's an FX problem. \n\nMy other criticism was that I wish the show would've taken a few more risks. I'm not familiar with the source material at all so I'm not sure if this series followed the source to a tee but I feel like making small changes would've been okay. For example when >!Buntaro stays back to fight off the soldiers and salutes the ship with Toranaga and everyone else to turn around and take on all of the enemies, I got goosebumps. But then he ran off screen and I thought \"okay well he's still alive\" I would've preferred him to have died in that moment, it would've been more impactful and imo would've been a better moment even if we wouldnt get the other moments he has when he returns (tension with Mariko and Blackthorne)!<\n\nAnother scene, when >!Mariko plans to Seppuku but gets stopped by Ishido and then goes on to die in the explosion, I felt like that also took away from the moment. It would've been more impactful if she committed seppuku immediately after losing the battle at the castle gate or when she planned it. When Ishido stopped her and she went on to hook up with Blackthorne and live on I thought for sure it was gonna snap back to her bleeding out and Blackthorne seconding her, revealing she was imagining what could be, but it didn't. Then she exploded and it didn't hit as hard because her death had been telegraphed already!<\n\nOther than those Minor criticisms the show was great, loved it. 9/10.",

Like, the new Beacon Keeper is alright but her character is almost too clean cut. There isn't a lot drawing me in there. And the conflict or drama that we are seeing between the two mains just wasn't that interesting this episode. Also I like the clarinet well enough but I'm not sure it is adding a lot to the show in this episode. The first time we saw her play in a previous episode it worked better and kind of showed something about her character. Now it felt a bit indulgent.\n\nArguably the best part of the episode (for me) was the part that was incongruent (and jarringly inserted) -- the flashback/hallucination to Halan's military trauma where he lost his team.",

I wasn't blown away, the acting felt forced in places. It was like a CW show with all the filler episodes cut out. It reminds me a lot of Merlin. I saw glowing reviews, but to me, it was just average.\n\nDick Turpin was quite funny and wholesome. I would suggest it is a good show for in between some big, darker shows with many seasons.\n\nNext up, I am going to check out Shogun.",

Preferably ones where there's almost NO chance you figure out the mystery but upon looking back you still see the clues.

I'm not 100% sure about the casting of the actual victim/survivor/subject as the lead role, but it worked out. If you liked this show \"I May Destroy You\" is a very similar autobiographical exploration of trauma and fallout. \n\n**Them: The Scare (Prime)** Holy CRAP. The first episode scared the PANTS off me. I foolishly decided to watch this at night alone while my husband was at a concert. I think part of the fear factor has to do with the incredible cinematography. It has a symbolic dream-logic feeling, while being absolutely stunning at times (the scene where Edmund Gaines sits on a bench in a locker room hyping himself up mentally to become a mascot character is unbelievable. It's so beautiful and eerie it almost looks like AI). I plan on watching the rest during the daytime. My only very slight complaint is the show appears to be giving the store away with focusing the marketing and the actual pacing/cutting/editing/plot of the show on the killer right away. Let us be shocked that this dorky mild-mannered person is a psycho killer. I also have a moral issue with TV shows lingering on serial killers lives, backgrounds, personalities, and motivations and making the viewer feel any amount of sympathy for them. It may sound tinfoil hat, but that type of thing feels very...\"elite agenda/Hollywood corruption\" and I'm very much not that type typically. \n\n**Mad Men rewatch (skipping around in seasons) Prime (purchased**): I'm writing a fictional novel set in 1960s NYC so **of course** I need to rewatch Mad Men. Seasons 3 and 4 will forever be my favorites, which means that 1, 2, 5 and 6 (7 is sorta dead to me, get OFF our cameras, Diana) have plenty of little moments to discover and savor.",

Seems to have picked up right where it left off, which is a good thing, it's a charming show and it ended S2 with a cliffhanger. I recall going into it with fairly low-moderate expectations, but by the time S2 finished I was sad there wasn't more, it's truly enjoyable with likable characters and thus far, a charming and heartwarming story. \n\nAnyone that likes Ted Lasso and has Apple TV, I highly recommend this, it's in the same category of feel-good show",

You'd have to write an essay on this crazy show (and there's some good ones online) that is so full of violence, sex, and nuttiness that Amazon doesn't show it when you browse the Prime catalog but you have to use the search function to find it. Not as good as Cowboy for me but worth a watch for David Lynch fans, Refn fans and general enjoyers of surreal and supernatural crime shows. The show moves at a intentionally very slow pace and is definitely not bingeable (it took be over a month to finish it) but lots of scenes will stay with me for a while, even if I don't think Refn fully knew how to structure the narrative or end the series.\n\n**Shogun (Disney+)**\n\nI'm with consensus on this show, an overall great watch that perhaps faltered slightly at the end. Hopefully this show's success will lead to more adult and sophisticated dramas continuing to be made in what's sure to be an avalance of video game ips moving forward.",

Rolin Jones, one of the S1 showrunners went on to run *Interview With the Vampire* for AMC+.\n\n*Penny Dreadful* (Paramount+/Showtime). Victorian gothic horror of the literary and grand guignol variety.  I also enjoyed *Penny Dreadful: City of Angels,* but that's a completely different show and they shouldn't have tried to call it a *Penny Dreadful*  series.\n\n*Ripley* (Netflix). Just dropped recently. Showrun by Steven Zaillian (*The Night Of*) who goes completely auteur and writes/directs every episode. Black and white, noir to the max, period ('60s) and shot in Italy. Zaillian's plan before the series was dropped by Showtime and then picked up by Netflix, was to do all five of Patricia Highsmith's [Tom Ripley novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Ripley), not just *The Talented Mr. Ripley*.  The series is much more Hitchcock-*Strangers on a Train* than Anthony Minghella's adaptation: Andrew Scott's Tom Ripley is much colder and sociopathic than Matt Damon's. \n\nNot my tastes, but you also might want to look into anything showrun by [Steven Knight](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1140275/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1): *Taboo* (FAST, Roku, Freevee, Crackle, etc.)*, See* (AppleTV+)*, Peaky Blinders* (Netflix)*, \\[SAS:\\] Rogue Heroes* (Epix)*, All the Light We Cannot See* (Netflix) and most recently, *The Veil* (Hulu).
