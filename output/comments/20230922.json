My wife, for example, really liked it, and her  anime experience and interest has been mostly focused on Studio Ghibli films. The cast is fun, especially the actor for Luffy, who serves as the optimistic hero anchor and absolutely nails it.  Not sure how they will handle the rest of the crew, but so far, they\u2019ve proven competent where many others have failed before to capture the essence of an anime show.  Oh, and I really liked how the events happen a bit differently than the anime, so for those who would watch both, it is not a boring scene by scene retread.\n\nFoundation s2 - 8.5 out of 10. I liked the first season and this one seemed even better.  It is so fascinating to see a plot unfold in time-skips of hundreds of years, especially because you are so invested in the Empire figures and their potential decline in power.  Some new characters introduced this season that have more personality than the main heroes of the story, and their involvement in the progressing story is quite interesting.  Not sure about the new big bad hinted for the next season, but the twists in the story towards the end are rich in variety of outcomes for the rise and fall of all involved.\n\nSex Education latest season - 5 out of 10.  The main character has stalled or regressed in maturity this the whole thing feels like is treading water instead of progressing to a satisfactory conclusion.  I watched three episodes and then read about the ending to see if I should bother finishing it and no, it isn\u2019t worth it.  Such a shame for a show that started so strongly and devolved into a disconnected mess.",

That's also why I liked Ted Lasso, but this show resonated with me more even though Lasso is probably a funnier show. The characters and their problems in this show were more relatable to me.\n\n**Black Bird** \\-- I loved Cobra Kai and I was in disbelief that comedic actor Paul Walter Hauser actually played a serial killer in another series, so I decided to check this out. I really liked his performance but thought this miniseries was good but not great. I wish the pacing of the show was better.\n\n**After Party season 1:  EP 1 & 2** \\-- Love cozy mystery shows, but while the first episode was fun it didn't hook me. Second episode hooked me in a little more as you get to see things from a different perspective. I'll continue watching. \n\n**Slow Horses season 1: EP1** \\-- I've only seen the first episode so far, but I immediately love the vibe and aesthetic this British spy show. I heard the show can be slow, but it's exactly what I expect from John LeCarre-esque spy thriller. Slow burn is usually part of the charm so I was riveted the whole time. Will continue to watch.\n\n**Prehistoric Planet S1 EP1** \\-- Dinosaurs! I didn't expect to immediately get hooked into this documentary but the first scene with a group of baby T-Rex's swimming with Papa T-Rex in the ocean was unexpected. There were surprisingly adorable, and I felt for Papa T-Rex after what happens next. Also will continue to watch.",

Love the six-ish separate cases that comprise one overarching case. The last season in particular looked visually fantastic, with an incredibly moody score that I loved. I've read there's most likely gonna be a three-episode final season coming around Christmas this year, so I really hope that happens, because the show did feel like it left several threads dangling.\n\nNow that I'm done with *Line of Duty* for the time being, I'm hankering for something to fill the void.

I love the main detective character and you'll learn some history as well. \n\n**Prime Suspect** \\-- stars Helen Mirren and it's interesting to see how things change in the real world (our world) as she revisits this role over the span of 15 years (1991 to 2006). \n\n**Doc Martin** \\-- one of my favorites. a medical mystery show with a lot of charm ; set in a remote seaside British town. \n\n**Chance** \\-- one of my favorite shows on Hulu before it got cancelled. Stars Hugh Laurie and the show oozes a Hitchcock noir vibe. \n\n**Traitors** \\-- a bit out of the box recommendation here, but if you like mysteries, I really enjoyed this reality TV show set in a British castle where the \"sheep\". the innocent people, need to find the \"traitors\" before the traitors kill them all (secretly vote the out of the game). It hilarious to see how they guess so wrong most of the time.  I enjoyed all three versions UK, AUS and US. Maybe you want to try the UK version first. \n\n**The Fall** \\-- stars Gillian Anderson, but it's a UK mystery / cop show. \n\n**Elementary / Mentalist** \\-- both were popular CBS mystery shows.  I like the banter between the main characters in both shows, which balanced out some of the occasionally gruesome murders. If you've read Sherlock Holmes before, you'll get a special kick of how the cases play out in Elementary. \n\n**Twin Peaks** (season 1, 2, movie, season 3) -- I'm guessing you've already seen this awesome show, especially season 3.",

And what appears to be a supernatural element isn't. :) She's got an upcoming crime thriller with Benedict Cumberbatch coming out *(Eric),* and I also liked her '60s period piece,  *The Hour*.\n\nFor cross-border crime, the Scandinoir Swedish/Danish show, ***Bron|Broen*** (Topic) is amazing.\n\nIn a similar vein, Harry and Jack Williams crime thrillers also do cross-border non-linear narrative crime thrillers.  [***The Missing***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXiOwboL774) (Starz) / [***Baptiste***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ1plvYFMrw) (PBS Masterpiece/Passport), [***Liar***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jHH3GIVCs) (AMC+), [***Rellik***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWnotKVwmpk) (Cinemax).

[***The Widow***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M) (Amazon Prime), and [***The Tourist***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j_StJNMtu0) (getting removed from Max).\n\nAnd there's always Hugo Blick, the auteur who does the hat trick: he writes, directs, and produces all of his episodes: [***The Shadow Line***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNYCSNsTZSc) (Roku, Hoopla, Freevee).  [***The Honourable Woman***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg3Yzfu5kYI) (not on a sub). [**Black Earth Rising**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugxQuVPmVZU) (Netflix), and [***The English***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmcsV8_BefI) (Amazon Prime).\n\nI'd also throw on Tom Rob Smith, but he may be more of an acquired taste: [***London Spy***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1PEQkpKTLI) (Roku),  [***ACS: The Assassination of Gianni Versace***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kos2EtBdg_M) (Hulu), [***MotherFatherSon***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn87RhvtG5Y) (not on a sub); and ***The Class of '09*** Hulu.\n\nI also really like [**C.B. Strike**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8TECB9GAk) (Max), but I also read the JK Rowling book series it's based off.  [The seventh of which was released today](https://www.amazon.com/Running-Grave-Cormoran-Strike-Novel-ebook/dp/B0C3CKHR3F). :)\n\nWhile it's not *Mindhunter*, to me the next best show is the seasonal anthology ***Manhunt***  which (so far) has been about serial bombers. Season 1 was [\"**Unabomber**\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUHbyTXB2J4), Season 2 was [\"**Deadly Games**\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foMucpnzrBU).  Season 2 is of special interest to *Mindhunter* fans, because you get to see Cameron Britten's huge range when he moves from playing Ed Kemper to playing Richard Jewell.",

It's a Korean series where 12 contestants (all incredibly intelligent) are locked together inside this living compound and face off against each other in a series of games. Each game is very psychologically focused, require high levels of strategy and game play. The games themselves have almost certainly the highest level of game design I've seen in a reality show. The contestants themselves have masters and doctors degrees, are competitive gamers, a professional Go player, poker player, lawyer, doctors, etc, and each player really adds a lot to the show. \n\nThe players can lose pieces as well, and if they lose all they are eliminated from the competition, and the last contestant wins the prize pot. I think a lot of people are going to be talking about this show in the next few weeks.",

Also, it is safe for kids to watch.  I'm kind of cautious about these because I don't want one of my little ones to be traumatized watching a bear rip a moose apart before I am ready to traumatize them myself. There was some drama - bears eating fish, animal fights, light mating, but nothing a kid couldn't watch.  \n\nWe also watched **Drain the Oceans** \\- much more dramatic and I noted a definite lack of Garth Brooks' dulcet narration, but still fascinating.  \n\nAnd, **Lost Treasures of Egypt.**  This series, I think we also watched on the National Geographic hub or app or whatever, follows four or five archeological teams excavating different sites in Egypt and it bounces back and forth between them pretty effectively.  It's not anything new but it is interesting to see these diverse teams doing actual work instead of a celebrity archeologist showing up at \"just the right moment\" to uncover some \"new\" discovery.",

Like ffs, if after 1-2 seconds of a zoom on a characters face that looks sad, I don't get that he's sad, then letting it run for another couple seconds ain't gonna change that chief, it also makes it boring, but line of duty never went there what a great show, can't wait to start s02.\n\nAlso watching: Peep Show(last season), I think you should leave, black mirror, Alfred Hitchcock Presents\n\nFinished recently: Les Revenants, Ghosts of Beirut, Foundation(I loved it more than the astroturfers),",

For example, a Jedi not bothering to use a lightsaber when so many of their friends right there are in mortal danger.  Really?  That's a sillier, fantasy-thing.  Same with letting a dangerous bad guy just run away instead of stopping them while they had the chance.  Really?  Anyway the show is decent regardless, and Thrawn is being built up to be a menacing and competent villain.\n\n**Wheel of Time S2Ep6**: This show is getting better and better as the season goes on and storylines really get developed.  I am really enjoying it.  I may re-watch the first season after just to see if my opinion of that has improved with what we've been given in S2.\n\n**Bluey**: Watched a few of the early episodes and these are surprisingly good.

            "body": "**AHS Murder House** on Hulu + **AHS Freak Show** on Hulu\n\nAfter enjoying NYC far more than I thought I would, I chose \"Murder House\" as part evening binge watch and part background TV. Murder House has so many plot holes, and dangling stories and is so campy and over the top, but it's still very enjoyable. I'm not one of those people who would watch this installments more than once, but I can see where some seasons might be \"comfort TV\" (...sort of). I will say I find Tate Langdon one of the most toxic \"TV Boyfriends\" of *all time* and I don't care if that's pearl clutching, he's a stone psychopath. He's on the same level as the man who murdered the nurses, except that guy was older, craggy, and not handsome and not Evan Peters with his baby bird eyes/hair so people are scared of him but not \"Tate\". But Tate is **just as dangerous**. \n\nFreak Show is...okay so far. The show overall kind of suffers if you watch season after season in order, the cracks really show and if you don't like \" Ryan Murphy Favorite Actor\" whomever (I'm not a huge Jessica Lange fan, and I find Sarah Paulson a tad grating over time) it can wear thin. I also am confused by the *intense* dedication Kathy Bates had to her Baltimore accent. Is the characters' background city important to the plot? It doesn't appear to be at this point--it feels like a major indulgence on the actor's part and irritating as hell. I actually like the \"Life on Mars\" sequence but it's also confusing--did she play this as a dress rehearsal, because Ethel comes backstage and says there's a sold out/packed house like...later that day/next day, but Dandy buys out the whole theatre (so that is sold out, but it's not \"packed\") and Elsa slumps down after the final lines into what seems like recognition that the theatre is empty and she's a failure. The show whiffs it when it comes to when to SHOW and when to TELL via exposition. We get long monologues and spoon fed crap like \"it's people in small towns who are the REAL monsters!\" and then when I could really use some explanation, it's interpretation time. \n\nVery excited for The Other Black Girl, Delicate, and the AMC+ options on HBOMax!",

I then binge-watching everything up to season 8, which was the most current season at the time. \n\nI eventually had some actor fatigue like you said. I also realized plot holes are just to be expected, as each season had a great premise and things often just fall apart in the second half. You're just really there to enjoy the wacky experience even though things don't often have a satisfying finish. \n\nI liked Lange and Paulson, but with Lange, by the time I saw Freak Show, the season just seemed to be too focused on her. Despite the large cast, it felt like a one-man show featuring Lange to me. It was too much, even though I like elements of it, like the \"Life of Mars\" segment you mentioned. \n\nStill if you continue to watch each season, it's fun to see the AHS expanding so you start to see easter eggs and references to previous episodes. Like in season 8 Apocalypse, if you've watched a lot of the seasons (in particular S3 Coven), you'll enjoy it all more because of some returning characters.  It's not the best season but I liked it. \n\nI haven't seen NYC nor the previous season Double Feature, but based on your rec, I'll check out NYC\n\nMy favorite seasons were in S1 Murder House, S2 Asylum, S3 Coven, and S6 Roanoke. \n\nS8 Apocalypse was fun too because of the nostalgia factor of returning characters but it does get rather silly.  \n\nEven though S5 Hotel isn't my favorite, somehow I think about that season a lot. It tries to recreate the vibe of S1 Murder House, but set in a creepy hotel, so I really liked the premise, but things just go haywire pretty fast. Some of the acting isn't good, and I had a lot of gripes but the season leaves a lasting impression.  Despite being polarizing, it's often mentioned in the r/AmericanHorrorStory sub.  Probably still worth checking out if you become an AHS addict, mainly so you understand what people are talking about in that sub. \n\nS9 1984 was the last season I saw, and I was really liked the retro 1980s horror vibe. I was really enjoyed it, but I didn't see the second half of the season.  I wouldn't be surprised if it went off the rails too, but I still want to finish watching it.",

Emma Appleton was good in the lead role as a barrister who had to figure out if her stalker ex client was trying to help or or was actually the cause of her problems. Colin Morgan was sufficiently creepy and compelling in turns in his role! This was nothing special but it was very watchable. \n\n**Miracle Workers s4** - I still think this is one of the better comedy series on the go today. The anthology format keeps it fresh and this Mad Max style season was as hilarious as expected. Pity WBD canned the series! \n\n**Top Boy s3** - A good end to a great series. This gangster drama is pretty much the U.K. version of The Wire and definitely ranks as one of my favourite British TV shows of all time. The final season was as compelling as ever with fun twists and turns. \n\n**Mask Girl** -  The first episode had me thinking this was going to be a weirdly edgy Korean romcom so I was surprised when this quickly twisted in to a fairly engaging and compelling crime drama that took all sorts of weird, but interesting, changes in direction. It even burnt through cast members fairly quickly but still managed to feel like a very coherent show despite its unpredictable nature. I ended up really enjoying this one. Netflix have had some weird but fun Korean thriller series of late and this is another for the collection. For those curious it was a solid limited series. \n\nNext up I\u2019m pondering **Shelter** or **My Happy Marriage**. I was all set to binge **Winning Time** but the news that HBO have shitcanned the show has sucked all the enthusiasm to get to it out of me.

I watched it on live TV 10 years ago today and now it's on Tubi if you're interested. 4/10 - honestly it had an interesting concept but needed better characters, writing, better execution overall. I think it was trying to be the next Lost. \n\nBut the only reason I remember it is because all of the marketing, trailers, everything pitched it as a survival competition show. The first episode plays it totally straight right up until the end when things take a left turn. Even as episode two starts you're still questioning whether maybe it's real or not. Frankly I think a lot of people were so disgusted with the rug-pull that they gave up on it right then.\n\nAnyway, it makes me sad to consider its lost potential. They should have played it like a mockumentary style, where it's technically part of it but they never reference the cameras - more like The Office. Or they go more meta and bring the cameramen to participate in the story, which they really didn't do much. \n\nSo that part was the most distracting to me story-wise. I found myself constantly thinking about the camera operators - why would they keep following these people around? Why would they keep filming when everything goes off the rails? Why keep up the pretense that it's a survivor-type reality show long after it's obvious that isn't the case anymore?\n\nAnyway, the mythology gets pretty messy and goes in too many directions but what there is could have been good fun. Lots of intriguing bread crumbs and plot threads where they could have taken it.",

Definitely my type of humor cuz I was legit laughing out loud throughout the episodes. It stars Chris O'Dowd and Rosamund Pike and the episodes are only 10 min long so it's easy to pop one on whenever. I loved Chris O'Dowd in Get Shorty and he had the same sense of humor in this.\n\nIt sounds like it would be really boring or depressing, literally the entire show is this unhappy married couple talking (mostly arguing) in a bar every week before marriage counseling. But it's not depressing or anything it's just constant funny topics and witty jokes. If the humor style doesn't appeal to you then it probably would be boring since that's the main appeal imo. But only takes 10 minutes to give episode 1 a shot. I loved every episode, though maybe not good as a binge since it's literally all talking. I watched like 2 episodes a day.\n\nDefinitely deserves way more attention, I'm guessing it's not well known because of the 10 min format. The 2nd season is different characters and I heard it's not as good so I didn't bother watching that. But season 1 was hilarious, highly recommend.",

Even when it is supposed to be exciting, it's not.  In The Phantom Menace, generally regarded as the worst of the prequels, there are two lightsaber fights between Jedi/Sith/whatever, and two people die.  In Ahsoka so far there have been, if I'm counting right, six them, and one person had a tummy ache for most of an episode. Blasters blast, and lightsabers whoosh, and never once does it feel like there's anything at risk for the protagonists.\n\nThe only thing this show is good for is making me want to re-read the Heir to the Empire novel and see if it was as good as it was when I was a teenager. Because Ahsoka is just beige paste stealing its villain.",

It reminds me of LOST and other TV that brings up a lot of really interesting things but at the end has NO idea how to bring them altogether into a coherent whole.\n\nWhat a a disappointment.\n\n(there is one great scene in season 2 of the twin doctors going to an obscenely wealthy family's house to raise money for a clinic)",

Unfortunately it was a drama/comedy, leaning way way way too much of the comedy end of things and I dropped it after just a couple episodes.\n\nAnd speaking of New Zealand, I'm watching the last episode of the wonderful, wonderful **Taskmaster New Zealand** tonight. Once I'm done with that, I'll catch up on the new **Taskmaster UK** season.  I tried the **Taskmaster Norwegian**  version, but for me a comedy with subtitles was hard for me, it ruined the timing of the jokes, so I dropped it for now.",
