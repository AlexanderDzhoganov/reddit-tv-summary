I\u2019m really liking the more air time for BJ and Keef. Such brilliant performances all round. \n\n**Silo** - halfway through and it\u2019s a lot better than I expected. The pacing of the mystery with the world building has me engaged. I really like that\u2019s there\u2019s clues to what\u2019s going on outside yet not everything is as it seems. I\u2019m enjoying watching Rebecca Ferguson a lot as the lead. \n\n**Hijack** - whilst it can be silly at times, the tension building and drama is top notch. Idris Elba is really well suited for thrillers imo. Looking forward to the finale. \n\n**The Afterparty** - Really liking the new cast additions and seeing the different genres in episodes again. It\u2019s a really watchable show. \n\nUpcoming:\n\n**The Crowded Room** and **The Bear S2** - excited to get stuck into these soon",

The new cast of supporting characters is really good.\n\n**Star Trek: Strange New Worlds** Seasons 1 and 2 \u2014 Still catching up but watched several episodes this week. I think there's a lot of room for improvement, but it's already my wife's favorite Star Trek show since TNG. The season 1 finale was very good. Who knew there were Klingon monks safeguarding the timeline? One more thought: they finally nailed the intro theme music again. It might even be better than TNG's.\n\n**Rabbit Hole** \u2014 Like *The Night Agent* but smarter with better acting. Edit: The plot was a bit shaky in episode two but got really good in episode three. Charles Dance elevates every scene he is in. \n\n**Never Have I Ever** \u2014 I teared up several times during the season one finale.\n\nI'm also looking forward to the new season of **Only Murders in the Building**.",

I also like the backstories on these characters, Stone is a mall cop with a perverted sense of morality, Sweet Tooth is a child actor that spent the majority of his life in an insane asylum...  etc.  Honestly everything about the show works, the world, the humor, the action, the vehicular combat and the violence.

Started it again and what a show, made it straight into my top 5.\n\nI'm in a mood to catch up on things I dropped so started the 8th season of **The Walking Dead** and watched all the way to the ending. I actually enjoyed it, the entertainment factor drops a bit in season 11 but I'm glad I picked it up again. Then watched **The Walking Dead: Dead City**, which I thought was very good, maybe because of the change in setting and having far fewer characters than the main show. Also watched **The Walking Dead: World Beyond** and was bored to tears but completed it, could not vibe with the characters at all.\n\nWill not watch **Fear The Walking Dead** for now, all them zambies get tiring. Now watching the first season of **The Great**, liking it a lot! The comedy and the drama are very nicely intertwined. Also watching **Hijack** and well, it's thrilling for sure but some very dumb plot choices are killing it for me, will finish it but as things stand, will only recommend it to thriller aficionados",

I know someone out there has a rec for something next that I haven't seen yet. \n\nWeekly:\nRighteous Gemstones - finale was hilarious\nThe Great Food Truck Race - finale was good\nWhat We Do in the Shadows - I love energy vamps\nIt's Always Sunny - it's always funny ;) \nTough As Nails - I've always loved this reality show. They're all hard workers, gender doesn't matter, and I'd be honored to work with anyone of the competitors in their trade. \nThe Crowded Room - finale was good. I enjoyed this show and was very curious how it's play out. \nIs It Cake Too - yeaaaaaah, it came to that.

Love the casting choices. The acting is top notch. And the levels of anxiety this show can cause is out of this world. Loved it, highly recommend!\n\nSilo - Wasn\u2019t really interested at first after reading the reviews here, but after waiting for it to air the whole season and binging it, I have to say it\u2019s quite good. The weakest link was Common\u2019s acting, as it can be quite rough sometimes, but overall it was a really nice sci-fi with an interesting plot.

            "body": "WEEKLIES: **Righteous Gemstones**, **Hijack**, **Justified: City Primeval**, **The Afterparty**, **Warrior**\n\n* **Righteous Gemstones**: Pure gold. Most recent episode solidified the genius of the plot they are spinning.\n* **Hijack**: This one is ok. \"24 on a plane\" is an apt description. However, it just doesn't engage me as much as other Hostage/Terrorist plot-centered shows\n* **Justified: City Primeval**: After this weeks episode, I am now convinced they are clueless about what made Justified great as it just doesn't feel anything like it. Including Rayland. If that's the case then what is the point?\n* **The Afterparty**: Love the individual cinematic styles per episode. This week's Wes Anderson tribute was amazing.\n* **Warrior**: I am behind on this. Will catch up when the season is over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINISHED: **Treme**, **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (s16)**, **Secret Invasion**, **Catastrophe**\n\n* **Treme**: Picked this one up and binged it non-stop from front to back. Been meaning to watch it forever and it was worth the wait. Made me miss being in NOLA and David Simon truly is amazing at what he does. Satisfying finish to the show as well.\n* **IASIP**: Season 16 overall was meh by my standards, but ep08 really stuck the landing. The shorter seasons do not really fit the spirit of the show imho.\n* **Secret Invasion**: I thoroughly enjoyed the season as a whole, but I agree with others that they fumbled the bag pretty hard in the finale. As well as not capitalizing on an intriguing concept and only touching on it at the end.\n* **Catastrophe**: Binged all 4 seasons in the span of this past week and loved it. It's like a cross between **You're the Worst** and **Breeders**. Really enjoyed this one and the writing is hilarious. Includes **Ted Lasso** alums Phil Dunster and Sarah Niles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBINGING: **Review (s04)**, **This Fool (s02)**, **Twisted Metal**\n\n* **Review**: Tried this one way back when but came back around since someone mentioned the last season is great. Loved the journey and about to start the final season. Andrew Daly is a gem.\n* **This Fool (s02)**: Have only watched the first episode so far since it dropped last night and it's just as good, if not better, than the first season. Looking forward to breezing through it this weekend.\n* **Twisted Metal**: Haven't started this yet but this is also on the docket for this weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTRIED: **Rectify**, **Primo**, **Show Me A Hero**, **The Cabin Chronicles**\n\n* **Rectify**: Watched the first 2 episodes and found myself not giving a single fuck about any of the characters, especially the main guy who comes off like Joaquin Phoenix's media interviews circa 2010.\n* **Primo**: Started on a suggestion from this community. Liked it. Will continue when there isn't so much on my current plate.\n* **Show Me A Hero**: Gave this a show a shot due to David Simon's involvement but the pace and subject matter didn't engage me at all. Oscar Isaac wasn't enough to keep me. Gave up on it.\n* **The Cabin Chronicles**: Started this thinking it would be a relaxing watch about building cabins, but it's just rich white people showing off their bougie ass, pimped out, finished product \"cabins\". Skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWAITING FOR: **How to with John Wilson (s03)**, **Reservation Dogs (s03)**, **Only Murders in the Building (s03)**",

And then in the final episode, we learn they've all had accidents that led to their being comatose and their bodies have been donated to science and some game developer is testing their new simulation technology on them or whatever before they can start beta testing with conscious humans. And then it just ends. That's not gonna be satisfying at all. I think we should get the answer piecemeal and maybe follow someone from the outside as well trying to find them.

I think the tone matches the good seasons of the original (after it stopped being a procedural): Raylan is still the coolest person in the room until he blows his top, his fellow law enforcement people are flawed but well-meaning (being fleshed out at a natural pace), and the full back story/world is being built in a mostly good/reasonable way. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the season. The two gripes I have:\n\n* The big bad is over the top. One of the things that made the original series great was how much you *liked* Boyd, Mags, Ellstin, the Crowders, and other adversaries because they were layered and balanced (sometimes even sympathetic) characters. Through three episodes, Clement is as simple as they come: singular focus, no doubts, no internal conflict. Yawn. Boyd Holbrook's performance is the only thing keeping the character semi-interesting.\n* Willa is just the worst. I get that part of the series is showing Raylan playing dad, but every time some real momentum builds in the main story, we get mired in some variation of Raylan calling Willa on her shit and her glossing it over by trying to make him feel guilty for breaking up their road trip even though *none of it is his decision:* >!the two guys rammed his car and pulled a gun on him, his boss told him he has to stay to work the case. \"If you really wanted me here, you'd find a way to protect me.\" How can he protect you when you immediately ignore the very basic instructions he gives you (stay on the hotel grounds) and unquestioningly sit down to dinner with a random guy who called claiming to know your father?!< Really hoping her role decreases as things go along.",

I thought it was going to be serious or with Matthew McConnehey (who doesn\u2019t do it for me) but it\u2019s with a different guy, who is cute - and it\u2019s upbeat. Some parts are cheesy but the overall is actually very good. (In my opinion).\n\nI also watched Delhi Crime recently- it was extremely interesting, I had wanted to foray into Indian series for a while. But hard hitting - it is not light viewing, it\u2019s something that more invites thought and can make you feel bad about the world, though the series also talks about how to solve certain problems. The specifics of the depiction have been critiqued for whitewashing real events (such as the actually non peaceful police treatment of protestors concerned about the case). So that can take away some of the interest - the crux of the show is seeing how society reacted to this event. It does seem there\u2019s a point to the critiques made of it. But it\u2019s an important story, just not. No violence is depicted but it\u2019s referred to in the story and may be triggering for many. It has a very loveable female police officer who is depicted using power for good - this is a big part of what I liked about the story.\n\nI also don\u2019t know about the ethics of using fictionalizes real events for storytelling- but I feel it\u2019s used in this case to raise awareness about real problems around violence toward women.",

            "body": "**Strange New World S2** - Been enjoying this season less than S1.  Not because the episodes are bad per se, but because I think they make this show so well that when they get a bit gimmicky (like the time travel episode, or the seemingly TOS-homage show where they lose their memories but make the episode very much like a TOS episode), or get too silly (the one with Spock and what happens to him when his fiance's parents are coming to visit) they are missing out on reaching the show's lofty potential, which is when they treat it more as a drama and we get to see great performances from the cast and great stories.  The most recent episode is an example of Star Trek at its best, and I hope they show more of that.\n\n**The Witcher S3** - Watched all of S3 in the past 2 weeks.  This show is a bit of an odd one.  I enjoy the show overall even though I thoroughly dislike most of the characters.  I love Geralt, but Ciri, Yennefer, and Jaskier all rub me the wrong way.  Most of the minor characters I dislike as well, though I admit to liking Tissaia.  I think it's because there are a lot of factions and strife and politics and that does tend to interest me.\n\n**Secret Invasion** - I've actually enjoyed most of the Marvel D+ shows, but the less said about this one the better.  This was so poorly conceived and executed, and the finale was probably the low point.  So disappointing.\n\n**Warrior S3Ep1** - Now that I am done Witcher and Secret Invasion I am finally starting the new season of Warrior.  Ep 1 reminds me of all the reasons I love this show.  It's ridiculous but seems to revel in it, and presents it all with dash and style and without shame.  One thing I will note: I have friends who struggle with shows with mostly-Asian casts because they often have trouble telling the characters apart.  They don't have that problem at all with this show.  Part of it is that some key characters have distinctly different looks, but I think a lot of it is because they give a lot of focus to individual characters including great facial closeups, which speaks well to the care and quality that this show is made with, and how they are unafraid to really focus on their Asian actors/characters.  I love that aspect of the show.",

            "body": "**Batman The Animated Series**\n\nFinished the first season.  I'd seen some of it (I'd guess around 2 dozen episodes or so) when I was a kid, and it really stuck with me from that.  However, this is the first time I'm going through the whole series, and it's given me a whole new appreciation for it.  I love the approach they took by having each episode be a kind of mini-film showing you one aspect of Batman's character, his world, and the types of stories that can be told there.  Some of it's typical superhero stories, which may always have the most depth but can be very fun in its own way.  Other times, it takes that type of story, but creates a deeper character study for the villain of the episode.  One of the most notable examples of this is \"Heart of Ice,\" with Mr. Freeze.  And while most of the series can be considered noir, there are episodes that lean more purely in that genre than others, leading to some of my personal favorite episodes (\"P.O.V,\" \"It's Never Too Late,\" \"Beware the Gray Ghost,\" \"I Am the Night,\" to name a few).  While they naturally have to give some concessions for standard \"kids TV\" restrictions, some of these were mature enough for a more adult Batman series, and show why the \"kids TV\" label is a bit deceptive at times, even if that's technically what it is.  There's also some great fantasy elements throughout (as well as sci-fi, in the case of the HARDAC episodes.), which are great on their own, and help pave the way for Batman's inclusion in the DCAU, more naturally than say early seasons of Arrow did in the Arrowverse.\n\nFrom what I've seen, opinions can vary pretty drastically in terms of which are the best and worst of the series.  Some are more widely disliked, although even those seem to have its fans.  I think this goes to highlight the fact that what you get out of each episode depends in large part on what you want from a Batman story (although there are certainly objective issues one can take with episodes).  For me, while I've mentioned a few of my favorite episodes above (though trust me, I could name a lot more), I'd say my least favorites are \"I've Got Batman in My Basement,\" \"Tyger Tyger,\" and \"Moon of the Wolf.\"  Although there's always a chance that may change upon rewatch, either with those ones improving, or other ones not holding up as well.\n\n**Sonic Prime**\n\nThis was a very enjoyable continuation of the first season's story. I like how the story started to feel more focused, even as it continued switching between realities, in part because the realities were pretty much already set up from the first season. The main conflict heated up a bit, and had some good twists. I particularly like the idea of >!Nine going against Sonic to save his own world!<. From what I see, it sounds like the series was planned for 24 episodes (so one more season's worth), which makes sense, since I can't see it going much farther than that. But with everything that's set up, hopefully the next season brings things to a satisfying close.\n\n**You season 2**\n\nTBH, I have pretty mixed feelings about this season.  When it started, it felt like it was a bit too similar to season 1.  In a way, I think that was the point, since >!Candice said she wanted to convince Joe that he'd fall into similar patterns, even if he tried to escape into a new life!<, but it doesn't change the fact that it seemed pretty repetitive at the start of the season.  However, I did get into it a bit more after a while, as the story started to evolve, especially around the time >!Candice shows back up again!<.  Love and Forty's characters grew on me throughout the season, especially Forty, who kind of annoyed me at first.  However, the story kind of fell apart for me right at the end.  >!I do realize there were hints about Love's true nature (and probably more than I remember), I kind of had the opposite opinion as I had to the first part of the season: They almost seem to try *too* hard to make it different than season 1, and by doing so almost make it feel like a Jumping the Shark moment to me.!<  I'll see how it goes in season 3, but at the moment I'm not a big fan of where this story is going.\n\n**Black Mirror season 6**\n\nProbably the weakest season to date, but I still enjoyed it.  As others have said, it doesn't have quite as consistent of a technology theme as previous seasons, with the last 2 episodes in particular feeling more at home in the new Twilight Zone or something.  That being said, if I were to rank the episodes, I'd say:\n\n1. Beyond the Sea\n\n2. Loch Henry\n\n3. Joan is Awful (good ideas, and I can see some people having this higher, but some of the humor wasn't for me)\n\n4. Demon 79\n\n5. Mazey Day (the only one I'd say I actually disliked)",

It starred Christian Kane as an ex-DEA agent who is trying to retire to a quite life in the Philippines but gets caught up helping the local police with stuff. It was OK. Had that same light Will Trent or NCIS tone. Watchable but nothing special. \n\n**Dragon Prince s1&2** - This younger skewing Netflix fantasy animation is pretty good! I like the animation style and the story has been very solid and enjoyable fantasy fare so far. I\u2019m a fan and looking forward to watching more! \n\n**Fifteen-Love** - This new British limited drama from Amazon actually turned out to be a lot better than I anticipated. I\u2019ll admit I went into this one with the totally wrong impression as the blurb had me thinking I was going to be watching a romcom or romance show. That was not the case at all. This ended up being a well crafted and well acted story about a former tennis prodigy who accuses her old coach of sexual assault when he resurfaces back in her life. I quite enjoyed the story as it took a while to unfold and our lead character was a complicated soul with a ton of flaws. The ending was a tad neat but I\u2019m not totally averse to a satisfying ending in fiction. \n\nI also had the chance to binge the final three episodes of The Witcher s3 last night. I thought the first two were pretty good but the finale ended up being weirdly dull. Spotted them setting up the kids for the YA The Rats spin-off due in 2024 and have to admit it looks a tad cringey. \n\nNext up I\u2019m heading for **Ghosts of Beirut**, **Evil s3**, and maybe **Secret Invasion** or **The Crowded Room**.

If there was a filming crew following you around 24/7 for years I bet that by the third month you wouldn't even think about them, you'd just go about your business. Yes, I'm looking at you What we do in the shadows. You know, I can put in the back of my head the nonsensical premise of the documentary series that films some vampires in NY, full access, they get in time everywhere they go, etc. But the wink-wink thing of the actor looking at the camera just makes the whole thing crumble for me. I guess it's all Martin Freeman's fault. Rant over.\n\nSo I've been rewatching **Long way up**, the docuseries of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman and their motorcycle travels across South America. Such a beautiful show. The beauty of the landscapes, the people, even the misfortunes, they all add up to put you in their skins, albeit vicariously. Of course this is champagne travelling, they have all the safety nets you can imagine, but still, very cool. I know these guys are busy and they are not kids anymore, but it would be lovely to see yet another installment of the series. I know that Ewan and Charley will surely be reading this, so here are a couple of ideas: travel through the tropics, (Long way Round, Tropics), Long way down America (this time the Atlantic coast of America, say, from NY to Florida to Cuba, Puerto Rico to Guyana, all the way down to Ushuaia).\n\nWatched the first episode of the new season of **How to with John Wilson**, which deals with a problem that you don't think about so much when you don't live in the big city like myself. And that is, that they are not very much shit-friendly places. Like, you have to buy stuff to poo and so on. The statistics that Wilson conveys are quiet terrifying, especially if you are a go-a-couple-of-times-in-the-morning type of individual. Like 1000 public restrooms for 8 million people or something.

I can see how it might get a little old if binging; I find it similar to The Office in terms of the type of humor and pacing, and I can't binge The Office.

It *nails* how people will go out of their way to ignore or brush off weird stuff to avoid conflict. \n\n**Real Housewives of NYC New Crew** still amazing. Still love Jenna Lyons. If I will still be #1 Jenna Fan in 5 episodes remains to be seen, but it's a very watchable, enjoyable show so far. A major breath of fresh air especially after how dark the old crew got. The 10+ years of petty grudges and bad behavior just calcified into total rot.\n\nLight tv week this week! I jettisoned AppleTV and Paramount+ is on the chopping block as well, so I am watching more YouTube and less \"real TV\" lately. But then again I have a long list of to-watch (still haven't finished Succession, among other things!) so maybe this weekend I'll catch up.",

Some heartfelt moments that nail the emotion and some strong performances from Segal and Ford but there are elements of it that I am not a fan of.\n\nFirst it has a little bit too much of that woke Hollywood inauthenticity that they mistake for being inclusive. There is a character Sean who is just an average looking, slightly overweight male character and 2 women talk about how he is beautiful and the daughter also has a crush on him. I'm not buying it. To make it worse the 2 women talk about it like they are going to have sex and the daughter is a high school girl and Sean is an ex military grown man. They don't explicitly state the ages but seems like there should be a bit of a problem there.\n\nThose issues aside there are also a couple of characters I am just not a fan of. Because of some of the better performances I will probably continue to pass the time but it is feeling sort of meh for me right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - Finished it up and most of what I said still applies. Segal was perfect for the role and is a really good actor. I always view him as a comedy guy but he brought a lot of emotion to the role. Ford (who I am not historically a big fan of) was also good here. The show in general definitely tugged on the heart strings and they hit the emotional notes a lot better than they did the comedy ones. \n\nAs I said above this had what I consider that Hollywood polish or inauthenticity that always makes shows worse than what they could be. Like they just add characters or dialog to show how edgy or inclusive they are but there is no actual weight to any of it. Checking the boxes if you will. \n\nAnyway it is worth a watch.",

I feel like he's a pretty handsome dude, who's a little bigger, sure, but someone being bigger isn't inherently unattractive, and doesn't take away from how good-looking someone's face is. And plus, people can't help who they're attracted to, so it's not unreasonable that the daughter character (blanking on her name, sorry) would attracted to him. And if you like someone's personality, they're instantly more attractive than if they had a shitty personality.\n\nBut yeah, when the show was airing, there were a lot of folks here commenting about how it was a little awkward to have the daughter lusting after the grown man that is Sean. Of course when we're teenagers, it's pretty normal to lust after grown adults, but it's still awkward to see it on-screen.",
