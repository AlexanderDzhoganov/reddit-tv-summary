An interesting glimpse into Paris and French Couture at a real interesting time with the Nazi Occupation ongoing and then ending. The acting and production are top notch. The story is Ok. I\u2019m sort of puzzled as to why this one did not hold my attention more. It is just weirdly lacking at times. That said, I\u2019ll watch a second season if they get one. \n\nThe one weird thing was casting Maisie Williams as the younger sister of Ben Mendelsohn. They are 30 years apart in age and are only supposed to be around a dozen years apart. It is a hard sell especially with the childhood flashback hammering home the point that they are not supposed to be 30 years apart in age. Both actors are great in their roles but it feels like a bit of miscasting when they are on screen together.\n\nNext up I\u2019m probably aiming for **Fallout** and possibly **Baby Reindeer** which seems to be getting decent reviews.",

It does feel like they've run out of ideas a bit though. Bringing back the East vs West storyline that was at the centre of its 70s/80s heyday, that can't help but feel a bit desperate even though they found a new twist on it - and the middle east reboot doesn't even have that! To make up for the lack of originality, it just feels like they're having to reach for bigger extremes and plumb new depths instead. The political characters looked like they were intended to balance that out with some comic relief to start with, but the writers have really jumped the shark with those now, and none of the characters are at all plausible or believable any more. It's a shame for what used to be such a solid series, and no matter what, it'll always go down as a classic now. It's definitely time to call it a day at this point though, so really I'm hoping that all those rumours of this being the last ever season are true after all.",

The finale felt like a proper finale in that it wrapped up basically all hanging plot threads like Danny's parents finding out he is part ghost, him finally getting with Sam, etc. I am glad they finally did all of these things and they wrote it as if they knew it wasn't getting renewed. Was a bit frustrating that it finally happened right at the end of the show though.!< While I am happy about those major events occurring in the finale otherwise the writing for the finale made no sense and was just frustrating.

Also really loved [her recent interview on the Stephen Colbert show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOp3_vVSQU). She has a such a cute laugh.\n\n**Baby Reinder (Netflix)** \\-- What a rollercoaster of emotions. Started off as a dark comedy about an over-enthusiastic female stalker and then the show took some unexpected turns. Binged watched it in two days.\n\n**From Season 1 & 2 (MGM+)** \\-- I love mystery and horror shows that are set in a small-towns, and while not perfect, this show is really solid (and a bit gory). I was hooked and also finished both seasons in two days. It does feel like a low-budget \"Lost\", especially with Harold Perrineau as one of the main leads, who is excellent in the show. Some of the characters were hit or miss for me. I really liked the eccentric characters the best, like old man \"Victor\" who has the mentality of a little boy but owns a pure heart, or the arrogant tech genius \"Jade\" who can be surprisingly emphatic and thoughtful at times. Hopefully the third season will come out later this year.\n\n**Poker Face Ep 9 & Finale (Peacock)** \\-- Great show and the season ended on a nice note with a Rian Johnson-directed episode before the finale (which was also great). His episodes (he also did the first two) tend to be my favorites and I just love the attention to set-design and lighting, as well as the writing. But overall, a really solid show.  Looking forward to see more of Natasha Lyonne in the next season (whenever that happens).",

She gets pregnant and he moves to London to be with her even though they barely know each other. It\u2019s fucking hilarious (there\u2019s a scene at the beginning of Season 2 where I laughed so hard I cried), but it\u2019s very real about dysfunctional relationships and addiction.

It seems to use Dr Strangelove as a jumping off point, especially  a scene when the heads of state are convinced living underground in an all out nuclear war could have its 'perks', as well as the movie's famous ending juxtaposing horror and black comedy with a sentimental old song from the 40's.\n\nSome of the music tropes are a little too on the nose at time but mostly work and all the old graphics and such resonate with me.  Stories based on video games have an inherent predictability in how they build suspense but there were a lot of interesting ideas in this and I was never bored.  Looking forwards to season 2!\n\nCasting Kyle MacLachlan as Lucy's father was one of those strokes of genius, she looks so much like she could be his daughter.\n\nI have to say though, I fucking loved the 3 cartoons in the extras on the Amazon page that are training videos for Vault Tec salesmen. At first I wondered if they were from one of the Fallout games but turns out these particular ones were done for the TV show. They are HILARIOUS and just perfectly done if you've ever seen any 'higher level' old industrial films from the 50's/eary 60's. Its so funny how they parrot the cheerful style but can't but help showing the bleak realities.\n\nOne thing I wonder is one of them mentions a 'forumula D\" for people too poor to afford to buy a place in a vault - is this what the Ghouls drink to keep going?\n\nAnyway, if you have not checked these cartoons out please do yourself a favor - my hats off to whoever made them - they deserve more credit.",

            "body": "**Defending The Guilty** -- Enjoyable single 6-episode series (maybe there will be more but it also stopped nicely), good comedy with interesting characters and evolving relationships. As I've found is typical in British comedy, doesn't hit you over the head with it, and doesn't assume the audience is a moron. Didn't explode my head but I didn't need it to, was happy I watched it, would watch more.\n\n**Invincible** -- I liked this more when I was watching it then now when I'm reflecting on it. Very \"The Boys\" (or maybe a certain comic book thing which they both draw from, I'm not sure) which I find enjoyable. I appreciated the animation style which felt like talking to me personally as someone who watched old GI Joe and the such, that was interesting and I liked it. Felt similarly when I watched **Legend of Vox Machina** Again this could be sprouting from some other fount, but I enjoyed it.\n\n**A Gentleman In Moscow** -- Really love this a lot. Usually I table anything with the \"slow drip\" of episodes, because I prefer watching all at once, but I've enjoyed this enough to put up with that. Highly enjoyable, though I've lost sight of a few character motivations recently. (Of course, because I have to wait between episodes). It's nice to get another perspective of this time period in Russia, but I still think there's so much more to unpack. I'd love to look at Russians and Russian historian reception of this.\n\n**Space Ghost Coast to Coast 30 year Anniversary Livestream** -- It was nice to watch a few episodes, though they looped too few. It is such a clear landmark shift, that's difficult to describe to anyone who wasn't watching physical Television Sets at that point in time. Not only did it set up Sealab and Aqua Teen Hunger Force but I think made a more subtle and lasting impact. Not having revisited the content since I enjoyed it *highly* in college, I was struck by how absolutely wholesome it was. Never punching down, always just ... I don't know what exactly. Exploring? I find I want to explore this vague memory/fever dream of an episode where the audio was overlaid with moms talking? Or something? Steve Allen episode was golden. Still solid after all these years, thank you Tad Ghostal.",

It ultimately didn\u2019t do much for the overall show, especially given how much she was at Abbott anyways. It\u2019s not like she had some big revelation about teaching or being at Abbott because she always knew she loved teaching and loved being there. !< not like it\u2019s going to keep me from continuing with this show - pretty big misstep but from a show that hadn\u2019t really made any yet. Hopefully this back half of season 3 is a return to form.\n\n**Superstore**: rewatch for me, but my partner has never seen it and I\u2019ve just him hooked on it now. We\u2019re almost done with season 1 and his favorite character is Tate, the pharmacist. I watched initially during COVID and had forgotten a lot of these early episodes were so funny, but I remember season 2 being hilarious so I\u2019m excited to get there.\n\n**Under the Bridge:** Just started episode 2 and still deciding if I\u2019m going to see this one through to the end. Pilot gave me Sharp Objects meets Mare of Easttown vibes but didn\u2019t hook me like either of those shows did immediately. Truthfully, it just made me want to rewatch Mare of Easttown. Let\u2019s see how episode 2 goes.\n- I have to give kudos for some great needle drops, though. \u201cRockets\u201d by Cat Power and \u201cSomething in the Way\u201d by Nirvana both used very well in the pilot.\n\n**Next on the List:**\n- Death Note (the anime, not the live-action, which I\u2019ve heard is an abomination)\n\n- Fallout (never played the game but I will watch Walt Goggins in just about anything)\n\n- 3 Body Problem (recommended at a work lunch yesterday, I\u2019m intrigued)\n\n- Shogun",

Won't speak too much on it as I'm no expert, but I've just loved the way its been depicted and I will miss this show tremendously\n\n- *Fallout* - finished it this week, amazing fun, feels like you're just playing a new chapter in the game and manages to capture the tone of the games very well without ever going too far into winks to the audience - or at least ones where it could've done, it still was done well enough to play for laughs/absurdity. Perhaps my favourite video game adaption\n\n\n- *Baby Reindeer* - ended up watching this in one night and holy shit, this just broke me. Tears multiple times etc. But a deeply personal story and the main actor is depicting his own experiences with being stalked, trauma and exploring his own actions within that and providing a critique of his 'role' in it without ever feeling like he's being blamed, but allowing the space to better understand how he ended up where he was in life to be open to such people in his life, and likewise how they became the way they were. As a man who went through years of abuse, this was deeply cathartic for me to see, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle the topic - note episode 4 has potential triggers for SA. Finally, Jessica Gunning as the stalker is incredible, like truly just absorbs the role and can't speak highly enough of her. \n\n- *Pantheon* - animated scifi/ai show, i believe, only watched the one episode so far and holding off on it so i can watch it with my partner and maybe smoke/take some acid etc. We love sharing this kinda show together, but I've heard very good things from those who have seen it\n\n- *Hannibal* - bit of background watching whilst I do other things atm, but rewatching after a few years - Mads as captivating as ever.",

And Saul's character isn't introduced until book 2.  So they didn't really have anything to do for this part of the story until the last few episodes which are their stories pulled from the second and third books\n\nBut the Tencent version also did have a lot of filler, expanded characters out who were only in it for a short time, made it more of a 'buddy cop' film with Wang and Shi both going into the VR and hanging out, and expanding out Wang's family with his daughter even interacting with Shi for an entire episode.\n\nI honestly wish we could have gotten something in the middle somewhere in between \"lots of filler and expanded characters\" and \"compressing characters and stories down into one season\"\n\nI agree that they really dumbed the science down though. I'm curious how this will play out in the following seasons as there are still a lot of scientific explanations for things, and some stuff has already been taken from the \"Future\" like >!the autodriving car trying to kill Saul!<\n\nBut honestly, the Netflix version did a great job of making the characters into real people (even if they are annoying at times) as in the books they are more just... I donno... weirdos who exist only to fit the narrative and make things happen to progress the story.

The corny humor took a backseat and a decent story (the best story out of any fallout games) unfolded.  I loved >!The origin of vault tec.  I'm very happy they chose to explore that story line.  i loved lucy & maximus journeying through the wasteland.  i loved elmer discovering the history of the three connected vaults.  i loved the cowboy's past and connection to the present. (btw that actor was awesome how he seperated being a famous actor and a burnt out ghoul)!<\n\n>!They fumbled brotherhood of steel though.  brotherhood of steel was the worst part about the show.\nthe armor is supposed to be badass but they have squeaky young men who can't fight wear them.  the part where knight titus fights with the bear was cringe and set the reputation for the brotherhood of steel being a joke!<\n\nIt started out a little rough but it really stuck the landing.

If both Shogun and Fallout are only 5/10 for you, I'm genuinely curious what shows you'd merit 8/9/10s?\n\nI'm guessing they'll fall into a quite different genre, but I'm just interested to find out what.\n\nI've not even downvoted you for that comment lol. You're just saying they're not your cup of tea, that's valid as far as I'm concerned. It's a personal preference/opinion thread, isn't it?\n\nI think downvotes should be saved for people talking bollocks personally, like if you'd said they were actually made badly or the acting was poor.",

Skipped ahead in eps, and it's been better than I expected once the plot solidified.",
