As a non-book reader, the place they end season one seems like a really interesting set up and I would love for it to get very cerebral, like Death Note. It's definitely making me want to read the books now.\n\nEven though I binged it hard and I sacrificed a lot of sleep because I couldn't stop watching, in hindsight I did feel the pace of the show was pretty slow. If sci-fi and borderline fantastical elements don't interest you then it's probably a deal breaker. Liam Cunningham is a standout for me, and Benedict Wong is quite entertaining as well. It was a good first season for me but I feel like it's going to be like the first three seasons of The Expanse where the season finales aren't really satisfying until the whole arc is finished.",

They don't antagonize or size each other up a lot.  \n\nAbbot Elementary - I dunno about this season. I like Janine's progression, but she seems like the supporting character now.

If you try to binge a batch of episodes, it might be a little harder to get through.\n\nIt's actually a US revival of the premise of the 2010 BBC series, *Accused*,  by Jimmy McGovern (*Cracker, Time*): where, while it's a crime procedural, you simply stay with the accused before, during, and after the crime and never center on the cops or the lawyers. Each episode is a self-contained story with a different set of characters, so it acts more like an anthology. And, with one notable exception, all the episodes are original to this US version.\n\nThe one exception (\"Robyn's Story\") is a straight-up remake of the most famous episode of the OG series: [\"Tracie's Story\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVVLFaNvvOk) which won Sean Bean a BAFTA, for his portrayal of what we would today call a genderfluid character (the US episode, directed by Billy Porter, the character has been changed to be a drag queen). I'm still kind of astounded that McGovern didn't get at least a story credit on the new version since whole sections of dialogue were lifted out of the original episode.\n\nThe showrunners on the US version are Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa (*Homeland, 24*) and David Shore (*House MD*) and it's been something of a masterpiece of representation and a parade of guest stars.",

            "body": "[***Renegade Nell***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9OmmeE_gZc) (Disney+). This is my most-anticipated show of 2024 (yes, I am atypical of this sub). I\u2019ve been following it since it was announced in 2021 and it was still titled *The Ballad of Renegade Nell*. Because the showrunner is [Sally Wainwright](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906550/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) (*Happy Valley, Gentleman Jack, Last Tango in Halifax*). And I\u2019ve loved all her stuff ever since [*The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard*](https://www.facebook.com/BritBoxUK/videos/the-amazing-mrs-pritchard-now-streaming-on-britbox/325683065975153/) back in 2006. I don't follow shows or genres, I follow showrunners.\n\nBut. She\u2019s never done fantasy/superhero before. So seeing how she and director Ben Taylor (*Sex Education*) had complete deft mastery of superhero action fight sequences at the opening of *Renegade Nell* was an absolute joy to behold. Wainwright heroines are always tough, wry, funny, and embattled. And they take some vicious punches and then come out swinging and give better than they get. And she\u2019s come up with some Tommy Lee Royce-level supervillains (OMFG. *Adrian Lester* as a sorcerous supervillain\u2014who\u2019da thunk it? The Herne the Hunter sequence with Lester in Episode 2 was just >chef kiss<.)\n\nI\u2019m only halfway through and I already know I **love** this thing to bits and I\u2019m really hoping they get a second season. The cast is amazing. You can find that out for yourself. But I do have to point out Pip Torrens is a little typecast and doing similar stuff to [his work in *The Nevers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlizw89r31k). And, of course, Louisa Harland (*Derry Girls*) is awesome as Nell. If you liked *The Nevers* period+superhero blend and/or the period feel/energy of *Gentleman Jack* (though this doesn\u2019t have the same level of queer content as *GJ* if that matters deeply to you), this one\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nAnd I am old, so there's another aspect here I love that probably won't apply to you. But I remember all those [Hugh Attwooll](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041129/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)\\-produced *Wonderful World of Disney* \u201860s/\u201870s UK/Disney co-productions like *The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh* (Patrick McGoohan!), *The Legend of Young Dick Turpin*, *The Fighting Prince of Donegal*, and *The Three Lives of Thomasina* (Patrick McGoohan!). This feels very much like a modern (post-MCU) streaming homage to those co-productions. Being Disney family-friendly, but still distinctly and uniquely British in the story, production, and cast. Loving that aspect of it a little **too** much, as I can blame *WWoD* for planting TV-show anglophilia fangirlism in me in my formative years so that I was watching BBC/ITV miniseries on *Masterpiece Theatre* in my pre-teens.\n\n\\---\n\nEdited to add: okay, I've finished it, and it doesn't end as strongly as it starts (the foot comes off the gas a little as Wainwright only writes the first five episodes), and it gets *very* YA (musical number!) by the finale. But I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Lester should do supervillains more often. I'm also not sure if this is meant to be a continuing series or a one-off miniseries, but they didn't close it off completely. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd man, now I *really* want Russell T. Davies to get Wainwright to guest write a *Doctor Who* episode. ([They\u2019ve been buddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLNr1e9jIY) since coming up together on *Coronation Street* in the \u201890s).\n\nSmall trivial note: My 2nd most-anticipated (also UK) show of 2024 is [Netflix\u2019s ***Eric***](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/benedict-cumberbatch-eric-limited-series). Because the showrunner on that one is [Abi Morgan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604448/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) (*River, The Split, The Hour*). A lot of you are going to be/have been scathing about anything with \u201cpuppets coming to life\u201d as its premise, so I\u2019m going to point to [*River*\u2019s \u201ctalking to ghosts\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNvhd-MfH4) and say that what Abi Morgan does with what appears to be a trite premise is not at all conventional; don't assume this will be either.",

This has a similar feel, and you can definitely tell during the first two episodes he directed. However, the quality slightly drops off with different directors, but the story is still fun and intriguing. Good entertainment 7.5/10\n\nShogun - This is one the best shows in recent memory to air.

Great concept, both seasons I watched were very strong. Great mystery puzzle, no huge shocking revelations or anything, just solid mysteries. Highly recommend.\n\nSilo - ehhh, are the books better? Thought season 1 was pretty weak and too predictable. I figured out a key reveal fairly early on and found the characterizations somewhat thin. The \"big twist\" raised so many questions!  \n\n>!Why? The whole season there are people insisting it's all a lie, it's actually safe to go outside and the evil cabal or whoever just wants to control people - except that's wrong because actually it isn't safe to go outside so the evil cabal is right. But people who are about to die are given a false vision of beauty and calm so that they'll clean a camera lens. I get that it's a punishment and a good way to get rid of defectors etc but it still seems really convoluted.!<\n\nAlso >!where are the dead bodies?? That was the first thing I thought in the first episode. If they've sent other people periodically and they all keel over before they get very far and no one ever brings them back in then the ground should be littered with corpses, remains, skeletons, even the empty spacesuits, something. But there are only the two. What happened to the other bodies? Is that something else explained in the books?!<\n\nConstellation - another one where I figured out what was going on fairly early on. Or at least I sensed where it was heading because I watch a lot of media that involves >!multiverse!<. It was a bit depressing because you kind of get the idea how the ending will turn out and it seems like it takes a bit too long to get there. But it was a solid miniseries and the ending, I thought, was appropriate and thematically on key. Then I heard they were getting a second season which is just so baffling to me because it really felt like a one-and-done type of story. \n\nI will admit the one thing I didn't get was the >!dead bodies \"coming to life\" in the space station. We've seen that the affected people can swap with their other selves, so is the implication that the live people briefly were able to \"swap\" with their other corpses from the other universe? I'm not sure I buy that but it's all that makes sense.!<",

S1&2 are just a great package of TV.\n\n**Fargo Season 3** It was good TV, but I do see why I stopped watching during this one when it aired. It just wasn't as interesting, and if it weren't for me pushing through Fargo, I probably would've dropped it again. \n\nIt had a great cast, but that certain something that the first two season inherited was just missing here, and the story didn't deliver for me. Especially the part with >!Raymond dying!<, which happened too soon for the story's own good, because that was the most interesting dynamic. \n\nWhat's left was MEW and I really didn't like how it portrayed her as a character I'm supposed to root for, because she's a \"survivor\" and had little adventure with the guy from Season 1(who just went along with her deal, because I guess he had nothing better to do, breaking out of prison...), and because she's going for the season's villain?\n\nLester Nygaard in S1 was the \"little guy\" who never saw respect, turned irredeemable opportunist. Kirsten Dunst and Meth Damon were victims of circumstance getting tied up in major events. Those were interesting dynamics. MEW was just a crook, egging Raymond on even when he wanted to reconcile with his brother. >!I actually said \"finally\" out loud when she died.!< She was just too shit a character to focus on imo. And I found the ending really unsatisfying as well. Not the Carrie Coon bit, that one was alright, but every other ending scene definitely was. \n\nOn to Season 4. \n\n**X-Files Season 1** First \"rewatch\" since I was a child. I put rewatch in quotes because as a kid I was really only interested in the Alien and \"cool monster\" episodes and didn't watch it all. I also don't remember much, except for *that* episode. So this isn't so much a rewatch as a first full watch. \n\nI'm surprised how well it holds up from a modern TV pov. The episodes, more often than not, are written really well, hold a lot of suspense, and the production quality is generally really good. \n\nThe supporting cast honesty needs mentioning. 1st season already is full of \"this guy\" and \"that lady\" you've seen in plenty of other stuff. Including people who are now main actors in their own shows(Titus Welliver) or movies(Brad Dourif). One episode even featured 4 different actors I knew from Seinfeld, Walking Dead, Earth 2, and other shows.\n\nIt also reconnects me with the monster of the week structure. In the first ten episodes you already get an alien abduction, Mr. Fantastic, a primal cannibalistic woman, a poltergeist, rogue AI, genetically engineered super kids and the Thing 2. And even if the story of an EP isn't really my thing, I found the dynamics and the way it was shot still gripping enough to sit through most of them. Except 2 or 3 which were so predictable from a 2024 pov, I kinda skimmed through them. \n\nI do love the show's humor. In a completely UFO-unrelated episode, Scully says *\"there's something up there\"*(referring to the mountains). Moulder: *\"Yeah I've been saying that for years!\"*\n\nThere's some sloppiness, like things not making sense in a \"who would care about this detail?\" kind of way that I associate with the early 90s. But when its good, its really good. Though it definitely feels like a *first season*. The Pilot is, in my book, one of the season's best episodes. Even the smoker is already in it. \n\nI'm in. Back in, or in for the first time doesn't matter. Definitely in.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve been on a real sci-fi binge this week! \n\n**Halo s2** - I loved the first season of Halo but have not been as let down by a second season of a show since Altered Carbon. I did not hate what we got but it was definitely disappointing. It felt like the budget got absolutely gutted! The worst signs of the budget cuts were the characters getting killed off wily nilly or only appearing in a limited amount of episodes but the fact they limited the VFX and had to pay off most of the production staff involved in the lighting of the show was also pretty damaging to the quality. The fact they could not even get the same actress back for the Cortana motion capture was just embarrassing as was the fact they could only afford to have the character on screen for about 2 minutes per episode. \n\nThe writing also took a big dip. It is like they flat out forgot about half the story arcs from the first season. I was unsurprised to learn they changed showrunner when I checked midway through watching the second season. The new writers did OK with John and most of the Spartans and really did develop both Ris and Vannak as characters as well as Soren but they absolutely wasted Captain Keyes, Halsey, Cortana, Kai, Miranda, and Makee. Which is a real shame as Halsey, Cortana, and Makee were the most interesting characters outside of John in my opinion. An equally bad job was done in both seasons with Kwan Ha. After her planet got glassed in the first episode why was her character even still around? Awful redundant character who only served a purpose early in the first season to introduce us to the world and spark some character growth in John. With all the budget cuts I\u2019ve no idea why they still tried to find screen time for her. The stuff with Soren\u2019s family was also awful. \n\nAnother big thumbs down for me was the space zombies. Space zombie immediately make every space set sci-fi show shitter. We had intelligent aliens in the first season with their own culture and that was getting rolled back hard in this season. I\u2019m definitely not a fan of that development. It was like some hack writers watched The Last of Us and were like \u201cfolks liked zombies and dead gays\u2026let\u2019s get both of them in the show in the most cringe awful way possible\u201d. \n\nSpeaking about the awful writing, can anyone explain why that new guy in charge of the Spartans was illegally cloning that girl so she could die over and over again? The revelation on her identity only made the whole plot arc make even less sense! \n\nAnother negative was the visuals. I know most of it will be budget related but going from the brightly lit fight cool fight scenes of the first season to the dark fight scenes that looked like they were low budget laser tag was a letdown. \n\nMeh\u2026I did not absolutely hate what we got but I was definitely disappointed they dropped the ball so hard. This was Altered Carbon s2 level stuff for me. \n\nDespite all my moaning I\u2019ll still watch a third season. There was a big quality drop but there is still the core of a good sci-fi show in here. \n\n**Twisted Metal** - This comedy sci-fi was..OK. Anthony Mackie was actually pretty good in the lead role. Some of the comedy worked for me and other bits feel flat but on the whole this was watchable enough. \n\n**Three-Body Problem** - I was unsure about the show while watching the first episode but I felt like it got stronger and stronger as the series progressed and we learned more about the characters and the plot. It ended up a decent sci-fi show. \n\n**The Signal** - No way to sugar-coat this one\u2026it was pretty awful. I probably did this low budget German sci-fi/thriller no favours by watching it after a run of big budget US sci-fi series but even without the unfortunate timing I still felt like this was a poorly paced mess of a show. \n\nNext up I might change things up an give either **American Rust** or **Gray** a go. I think I need a bit of a break from sci-fi before I dive into **Constellation**. Thought I might dive into some fantasy instead with **Renegade Nell**.",

I liked Friends, Seinfeld, early seasons of Big Bang Theory, Everybody Loves Raymond and etc. when I was a kid, but none of them to the level of B99, and so I never really watched any of them entirely. I tried Always Sunny and Community, but I didn't really stick with them.\n\nI think I'm usually not much of a fan when so many of the main cast are just kinda unlikable people if they were real? Also, as an Asian North American, I find things a bit uncomfortable as a casual watch when it hits too close to home (i.e. Kim's Convenience and Fresh Off the Boat). Looking for characters who are relatable, but maybe in a weird, exaggerated sitcom way?\n\nI've been eying Modern Family, not sure I would like it though.",

            "body": "3 Body Problem  \nFormat: Series (8 episodes)  \nStreaming Service: Netflix  \nGenre: science fiction  \nLength: 45-60 minutes  \nLogline: Science is broken and events that can only be explained as miracles are occurring. Elite scientists around the world keep dying under mysterious circumstances. A VR game of unexplainably advanced technology lures in those who play it. A group of friends, largely scientists, from Oxford find themselves at the heart of a mystery that might be bigger than humanity itself.   \nKey Creatives: The showrunners include David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, best known for adapting a little HBO show called Game of Thrones. (It should be noted they have a third showrunner, Alexander Woo, who I am less familiar with.) The list of executive producers attached is impressive, although EP is a title nebulous enough that it could mean anything when it comes to concrete contributions. Exec producers include Rian Johnson (writer/director of the Knives Out franchise), Brad Pitt, and Rosamund Pike. Benioff and Weiss are again adapting from a beloved book franchise.  \nStars: Largely an ensemble piece. I was very excited to see John Bradley (aka Sam Tarly from Game of Thrones) and Liam Cunningham (aka Davos Seaworth, another Thrones alum), both playing against their Thrones character types. The rest of the cast was relatively new to me, but ultimately I was there more for the story than for the performances.    \nWhat to Know: 3 Body Problem is based on a book of the same title, which is the first of a trilogy called Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past by Chinese science fiction writer Liu Cixin. The TV series makes the story more international by adding a core friend group from all over the world and adapting character arcs to be featured more evenly compared to the book structure. There are two timelines - one taking place in 1960s China during the Cultural Revolution, and another in the present across many locations.   \nThoughts: The mystery and the atmosphere of this show is so compelling. The plot speeds along at a breakneck pace - the end of episode one could be a season finale for a network version of this show. I appreciate the moral gray almost all the characters live in, although the performances themselves didn\u2019t pop for me. This is hard science fiction but with enough human stakes to keep your interest if sci fi isn\u2019t your genre of choice. There is a set piece in ep 5 that I need to go back and rewatch. Remember: you are bugs.   \nGen V  \nFormat: Series (6 episodes)  \nStreaming Service: Prime Video  \nGenre: superhero dark dramedy  \nLength: 40-60 minutes  \nLogline: Welcome to Godolkin University School of Crimefighting, a school dedicated to shaping the next generation of superheroes. Four students find themselves fighting for more than a good ranking when the cracks in the school\u2019s foundation start showing.   \nKey Creatives:  Created by Eric Kripke (who developed The Boys for television), Evan Goldberg (longtime collaborator of Seth Rogen, and creator of The Goldbergs), and Craig Rosenberg.   \nStars: The ensemble cast is largely unknown young actors, the most name recognition going to Patrick Schwarzenegger (who has had some small roles, but is best known for his dad, Arnold). Guest appearances from The Boys are sparingly and tastefully done.   \nWhat to Know: This is a spin-off of the The Boys universe, set at a university that trains young powered individuals, with it\u2019s at the crime fighting school or the performing arts school. It references The Boys without feeling too tied in. Honestly, you can enjoy this show without having seen The Boys, even if you don\u2019t get every reference. Unclear how directly this will tie in to future seasons of The Boys.  \nThoughts: As dark as this show is, it has this compelling mystery that keeps me clicking on \u201cnext episode.\u201d The power sets are wonderfully unique and used exquisitely. I like that I didn\u2019t have a pre-existing relationship with any of the main actors, so I fully saw them as their role without any baggage. It\u2019s truly The Boys meets Degrassi. I know I\u2019m invested in a show when I\u2019m devastated by a relationship falling apart. I expect a show in The Boy universe to gross me out and fascinate me, but not make me laugh or give me chills.   \nUpload (Season 3)  \nFormat: Series (8 eps)  \nStreaming Service: Prime Video  \nGenre: AI afterlife sci-fi comedy  \nLength: 30-45 minutes  \nLogline:  \nKey Creatives: Created by Greg Daniels, who adapted The Office for the US and co-created Parks & Recreation and King of the Hill.   \nStars: The cast is unknown to me, but they nailed the characters out of the gate.  \nThoughts: I find it fascinating how many comedy creators feel the urge to create shows about the afterlife (looking at you, Schur.) I love the premise: a comedic love triangle between an uploaded simulated boy, his girlfriend who is paying for his digital afterlife, and the still-alive \u201cangel\u201d employed to act as a concierge for the digital afterlife. I do think by season three, the premise is stretching thin - there are now two Nathans, one uploaded and one downloaded, each dating a different girl, a conspiracy beyond why Nathan was killed, and generally a lot to keep track of. I\u2019m not sure I was as charmed as I was by the first two seasons. This is a show where I find the more serious the stakes get, the more I\u2019m drawn to the side characters who largely provide comic relief. That said, S3 ends on a major cliffhanger, and I was relieved to find out it\u2019s getting a fourth and final season!\n\nMore reviews on television and film [here](https://ariellereport.wordpress.com/2024/04/04/wiwtw-april-1-3-body-problem-gen-v-upload-ghostbusters-frozen-empire/)!",

They are accelerating a ship to as fast as they can get it but it will quickly pass all the bombs laid and continue going.  There's no air resistance to slow the ship down (a body in motion tends to stay in motion) so it will stay at the speed they accelerate it to indefinitely unless it hits another object.  It will still take hundreds of years to reach them but it'll reach them hundreds of years before they reach us.\n\nAnd the ships arriving are just travelling. They aren't breaking new scientific ground on the way.  They will be at the same technological level as they did when they left.  Which at this moment is far advanced beyond humans.  But the concern is human development accelerates at an exponential level so by the time the aliens do reach us, the humans will have evolved past the ones in the ships.  Past the ones on the home planet actually because they could get stopped by another chaos era or five while humans keep making progress faster and faster",
