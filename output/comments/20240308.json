Where it checks if the show name is ascii so the \"\u014d\" in Sh\u014dgun excludes it. https://github.com/GrubHubGitTub/r-television-Weekly-Thread-Data/blob/master/showfetch.py#L15\n\nThere's no comment about it, so without knowing why that check was put there in the first place I can't say.

I'm absolutely loving this new version, and like the changes they've made. My parents (who are native Japanese) are also liking it too. \n\n**Mr & Mrs Smith (Amazon) ep1** \\-- I just started watching this I love the aesthetic of the show. The non-linear editing and camera work reminds me a little of Steven Soderbergh's films. I like the contrast between awkward romance and intense action. \n\n**Doctor Who (2005 Revival series) ep1** \\-- man, I haven't seen this in so long and I was glad that the premiere episode still held up, even though I originally saw this almost 20 years ago. I loved Rose as a companion and I still really like Christopher Eccleston portrayal of the the Doctor. \n\nSo I have a question to any Doctor Who fans. I stopped watching after David Tennant left back around 2010, so that was almost 15 years ago. \n\nDo you think it's worthwhile to re-watch the whole thing from the beginning, or should I just continue where I left off, beginning with Matt Smith's arrival as the new Doctor?\n\nOne of the cool things about Doctor Who is seeing all the Easter eggs, and how it ties in with the previous episodes, and also recognizing the cameos of previous characters, but I've forgotten so much.",

For a while it was better because of more focus on Rosie and Crosby (and less of Buck/Bucky...especially less of Buck Clevin) since they actually seem to have some progress and character development.  Now it's back to more attention on Buck/Bucky but this time it seems like there's at least little bit of effort from Austin Butler to make the Clevin character not seem like a total waste of time on the screen.  I wonder if he was trying to play the character as the strong, silent type but just came across as a kind of black hole where lots of things go in but we never get anything back from it.  I really wonder how different the show might have felt with an actor and director who could get more out of that character.  The new stuff with the Red Tails adds a new dynamic though it does feel somewhat tacked-on since it came in (pardon the pun) from out of the blue.\n\n**Shogun Ep 1-2**: As everyone else has said: it's terrific.  I should get caught up this week.  I noticed at the start of Ep 2 how they had to kind of do a recap of everything since it can get pretty confusing with the different Japanese characters/factions/politics going on.  One thing I have learned from this show: I had no idea that so many Japanese had converted to Christianity, and that it was causing some internal strife within the country.",

For those who haven't seen it, the show was made by David Simon and concerns Times Square in the mid-70s, when it really was a den of vice. I was in New York a lot at the time, and they've captured it perfectly, with a great soundtrack of music of the time (although Times Square was more disco than CBGB). The acting is terrific and the story of the area turning from street prostitution to massage parlors to hard core porn is interesting and well written. Can't recommend it highly enough. I walked through there a couple of years ago and while it has been Disneyfied, it's still pretty grungy on the fringes.",

Even if you don't agree with certain characters stances or outright dont like them (Gaius for me) they have their ups and downs.\n\n\nEasy (2 episodes, on hold?)- watched this on a whim during a bout of insomnia, wanted something I thought was trashy lol. If nothing else it's relatable if you've been in an intimate relationship whether it be nascent or long running. Mumblecore might not be for me so time will tell if I continue\n\n\nFleabag- I thought this was gonna be a one note sex comedy after the first scene. Turns out I was delightfully wrong. Extremely funny, heart rending, and probably the best use of the fourth wall ive seen inna while. The titular character isn't that great of a person but I just wanna give her a big hug (Phoebe Waller Bridge being cute as a button helps lol). Highly recommend and it's really easy to binge if short on time; watched it in two days.",

In season two, you're already at the point where you're used to watching the main character talk to us, the viewer. And then there's that moment where another character catches her and said something like, \"who are you looking at?\" and then looks right where she was looking, into the camera, and in that moment, it was so jarring and unexpected that I felt like I was being spied on. It was a genuine shock, similar to if you were to glance out your window and see someone staring right at you. It made me recoil a little bit because of how voyeuristic it felt.

S1E3. HULU. i forgot about this. started watching then forgot about it. saw the second season came out so here i am continuing! it was another fun one and i have no clue why i stopped checking it out, probs got distracted of course lol\n\n- **Das Signal//The Signal**. S1E1. Netflix. German language original (i do not watch it dubbed). another space scifi show. seems to be preparing people for the *3 Body Problem* at the end of the month lol. honestly it feels like a discount *Constellation*. but i enjoy my scifi and space just for being in space lmfao, and i\u2019m enjoying it so far. it\u2019s a mini series with only 4 episodes, and they all are barely over an hour (and probably not over it if you\u2019re not watching the credits). so it\u2019s short enough and interesting enough to get me to continue watching\n\nedited to add as i watch stuff today:\n\n- **Queens**. S1E1. Disney+ (National Geographic) narrated by our lovely Angela Bassett. she sounds wonderful! and besides that it\u2019s your normal nature doc. except instead of focusing on both sexes, it\u2019s only one. i enjoyed it for background noise :)",

It's just the nature of light, light is like a wave and collapses into a particle for this reason: the only way to observe light is to interact with it, which in effect is an energy exchange, and that's why light collapses into a particle from a wave. \n\nThis is the kind of new age misunderstanding about the observer effect is on the level of \"what the bleep do we know?\"\n\nAlso I don't understand why they're in the modern day and one of the characters is receiving a nobel prize for demonstrating particle entanglement, one particle effecting the other instantly regardless of distance. This has been known for a very long time.\n\nAlso theyre alluding to spooky action at a distance, which doesn't violate our understanding about the maximum speed limit of the universe. \n\nYes two particles can be light-years away and one can effect the other instantly. However this does not violate faster than light(superluminal). A more accurate view of the speed limit, is the speed limit of information.\n\n\nSo even though two particles can instantly effect the other, it doesn't violate the speed of information/light, because that information must travel through a medium, like a wire, wave, or laser. \n\nRegardless I'm enjoying the show enough, but not loving the way they are misrepresenting quantum physics.

It's about a hectic night in a restaurant shot all in one take. You could call it the Uncut Gems of eateries. And then when I first watched The Bear I thought, \"This is just like Boiling Point but a TV show!\" And now here comes the TV show, most likely greenlit because of the success of The Bear. The first 10 minutes of the first episode is all in one take just like the movie, but the the credits happen and it becomes a conventional show. So far I'm enjoying it!

It was really good!\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I found it to be very mature, restrained, and naturalistic in its writing. Usually, in shows/movies, we see characters who have a dramatic rise or fall. But in real life, usually the \"good\" people fuck-up eventually, and the \"bad\" people don't always get their comeuppance. This show does an excellent job of representing natural characters, and a realistic-seeming workplace of complex humans. \n\nEven though it seems to be advertised as a limited series, I hope they undo the limited-ness by renewing it for another season. I'd really like to see more of this. Plus, it would be really wild to have its trajectory ultimately be:\n\nShort film > feature film > limited series > continuing series",

It hasn't scratch the itch like the **OA** did, but it is still pretty good. 7/10.\n\n**Halo** S2 has been amazing. Just skip the first season and watch a recap instead \u2014 this season isn't that heavily dependant on the previous one, except for a few minor continuities. Fantastic. 7/10\n\n**Lessons in Chemistry** has been a delight. Yeah, science! I'm right now studying chemistry to pass time and decided why shouldn't I give this show a try. Absolutely love it! 7.5/10\n\n**Reacher**, boom boom boom. Yeah! wreck up the whole squad. In real life, they'd be shot at first sight and be done with it, lmao. But this is a work of fiction so it's a good to watch when you're snacking and don't want to get too much into dialogues. Just enjoy the actions and kaboom phew phew phew. 6/10.\n\nI'm so cross about how Amazon butchered **Utopia** adaptation, smh.\n\nStill bitter about what Netflix did to **OA**, they could've at least negotiated for a film release instead.\n\n**Curb you enthusiasm**, this season has been, well, doing okay. It may have to do with everyone aging and they just got too 'old' and exhausted for their roles. I'll watch this series out of respect for the cast because they gave us a lot of hilarious moments. It's still a pretty pretty pretty good show though.\n\nNo show made me fall in love with the premise like **Community** did. Not one show that I can think of which made that great of an impact on me personally. I watched Community during it's initial runtime, before everyone was aware about it. You see, the whole crowd of audience were hooked on The Office and some other stuff. Community was a hidden gem that only a few had any knowledge about. Let me say this, this was during 2009 or 2010. And watching the first episode felt like it belonged to another time. While other shows were heavily dependant on procedural and formulaic approach of doing things. Community went in and bought something original instead of mediocrity, it was made for millennials in mind. This was our generation's 'genre' and it will always have a special place in my heart. Well, at least for the first three seasons. The rest is like a good snack.\n\nPatiently waiting for **Shogun** and **Tokyo Vice** series to end so I can binge watch it.\n\n**Animation/Anime:**\n\n**Frieren Beyond** is whimsical and I am savoring every episode. Pretty amazing I tell yah. 8/10\n\n**Pluto**, if you loved **Monster**, you'd probably love this too. 7.5/10\n\nEdit: grammar.",

Admittedly a lot of these cases are enjoyable to watch, but some just feel life filler episodes and a tad repetitive.\n\nAnd then there's the love affair with the ex-wife which I *really* don't care about and is honestly giving off soap opera vibes, that's probably the one aspect I'm finding tedious to watch and making me second guess my opinion on the show\n\nI'm going to stick with it, mainly because Boyd is an extremely likeable train wreck of a human being and I have no idea what they're planning to do with him, but I'm also growing pretty fond of the rest of the cast (save the wife/new hubby duo), and again, it's fun, I'm sure it hit its stride by now and I'm no longer hoping for some complete turnaround that'll elevate the show to some next level shit, but I'm fine with that for now.",

I found the dialogue kinda lacking, but I liked the overall mystery and setting. Then I watched the fourth episode, and my excitement started to dwindle. Then episodes five and six came, and were so incredibly frustrating. The story itself is nonsensical, and the writing and dialogue are completely amateur. \n\nI'm usually *so* forgiving of shows/movies, but I felt like this one just  squandered the awesome potential of its premise and setting. The writing quality made me realize that I\u2014notably *not a writer*\u2014am apparently fully capable of writing a show that HBO would spend $60M to produce. I just don't get it. The dialogue is flat-out awful. \"Time is a flat circle!\" and \"I'll shoot your fucking face off!\" made me laugh my ass off from secondhand embarrassment.",

Its rare that a show can really surprise me the way this show did. Engaging mystery, although formulaic with the >!on this episode we will focus on a character we will make look steadily more and more suspicious but its a red herring!!!<.  Also I thought the lads had far more chemistry than football lad and blondie, not in a way that affected my enjoyment, just made me laugh when I realized how wrong I had been reading the scenes.  The storylines of the ghosts were sweet and I liked how they resolved, especially the footballer.  The living characters too, the third wheel friend's story GOT to me.  The main character has some deliberately unlikable qualities (subjective) that make sense and drive the story forward.  Its hard to write unlikable people in a way that doesn't turn off the watcher and I think they did a good job with the insufferability of our main detective duo.  They're teenagers.  They're delightful, and very very stupid.  \n\n**Dungeon Meshi**: its perfect.\n\n**Revolutionary Girl Utena**: its so gay.  Its pink and there's swords and now there are cars???  In the duels???

We all know she\u2019s returning to her classroom at some point, just like we all know we\u2019re revisiting Janine/Gregory soon. I can respect not wanting to rush things but right now it feels like the district position is merely an obstacle meant to keep Janine away from Abbott and her eventual beau. \n\nThe alternative here can also be to give Janine more to do at the district or at other schools, like anyone else in her position would be doing. I love Janine\u2019s dedication to her school, but I would hope that the district job should be introducing her to new experiences and places and widening her mind to how she can help all Philly students in the district and not just her own. THAT would make \u201cJanine at the district\u201d seem like a meaningful way to get her character to grow and not just a roadblock to the inevitable.",
