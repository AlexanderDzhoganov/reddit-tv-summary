It holds up quite well for its age. The individual stories are very good. In particular the episodes with the missing pilots in the airbase, the killer who can stretch and break into anywhere, and The Thing ripoff episode (that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve gotten).\n\nThe only episodes I didn\u2019t like so far are the cannibal Neanderthal one and the killer AI one.\n\nMy main comparison is to Fringe (seen all of it) which maybe has worse individual stories/episodes but a more interesting wider story/universe.",

But that's all part of the fun and appeal of the show for some strange reason I can't describe. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nC) Some of the scenes/episodes are pretty \"slow\" but again it's a fun slowness, in a weird way. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nD) As for the AI episode, that was actually one of my favorites! But fair enough, there's all kinds of weird plots and storylines throughout the seasons, that will appeal to different people. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nE) If you like X-Files, then you'll probably really like the 1990's countershow: Outer Limits, for all the same reasons as above. \n\n#PLEASE STAND BY! \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFINALLY... \n\nSounds like you might have missed out on some great 90's shows, so I'd STRONGLY recommend you check ER if you have not. \n\nIt's a long multiseason epic journey filled with amazing medical emergency scenes (that were filmed with an innovative new technique for the time, of a camera just moving through the ER like a person, from room to room as doctors race to save multiple patients from disasters, or what not). \n\nAll the characters are amazing/fun, and so well acted. I can't believe the amount of acting talent that went through one show! \n\nAnd there's also tons of personal-drama scenes, and soap-opera romance side plots (that are actually pretty fun). \n\nBy the time you get through watching this epic series, you'll feel like you lived the life of a medical student, and had all kinds of romance and adventure along the way! \n\n------------------------------------\n\n(NOTE: there's other medical shows that have a lot of soap opera romance, but ER is much better, in my opinion, because it also maintains a really strong focus on medical science, and the life of doctors, nurses, and what it's like to be a med-student.) \n\n------------------------------------\n\nAnyways, wow this was an annoyingly long comment I typed, in response to yours! \n\nBetter stop typing here...",

Not even that, the very first scene Assad Zaman filmed as Armand was the big argument with Louis. It sounds nuts to me, but maybe it helped him to reverse-engineer his performance to include the clues to his real nature throughout the season.\n\nI struggle to think who gave my favorite individual performance in the scene this season - they are all so crazy good, with so many outstanding scenes to choose from. Assad Zaman as the evil gremlin in the 70! Sam Reid during the trial talking about the sky drop! Delainey Hayles chewing Louis over his idiotic love choices! Ben Daniels imitating Louis in the restaurant! Eric Bogosian delight at exposing Armand! So so good. I think however that Jacob Anderson still had the best overall performance - showy heights, subtle lows, everything perfectly balanced.

The pig mask caught me by surprise the most for some reason. !<\n\n**Serial Experiments Lain (1998)**. Oddly enough, failed the 3 episode rule, but it was short enough so I just kept watching. Started feeling into it by the 5th episode or so. I didn't find it as crazy as I hoped but it was one of the few cases where I liked the style of it and the animation first and foremost and just found it an enjoyable watch. Love the pastiche and lots of that 90's concept of internet screens, don't mind the typos. That opening theme is also now permanently stuck in my head.\n\nWould have probably been all over this if I saw it in like 2000, seemed very much ahead of its time on the cyberpunk themes or whatever you want to call them.\n\n**Psych (2006), S1** - enjoyable enough funny show. Unfortunately I find the MC rather hard to like, he has that douchbag energy that I see here and there that's never been my thing, but I quite like the side characters so that levels it out mostly.\n\n**Person of Interest (2011), S1** - got quite into this, ate S1 in a weekend. The premise is uhh, definitely extremely iffy, so I wasn't really sure about it. It seems self-aware enough and developing somewhere, though. I rather like all the characters and I like that the show is in the more old school format of long episode seasons so we have the opportunity to get familiar with the characters and develop the background (I always found WW too fast, in comparison).

            "body": "So, with Star Trek Prodigy coming up on Monday (way too excited about this, lol), I decided to get through a few seasons of shows before then:\n\n**Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) season 3**\n\nI've been enjoying this show so far, even back in season 1, with it gradually and steadily getting stronger as it went on.  Season 3 continued that with some pretty solid arcs early on, and then the season kicked into high gear in the latter half of the season.\n\nI liked how this season really pushed Ahsoka's development as her own person, rather than Anakin's underling, through both the main story arcs and a few side-adventures.  In that sense, I thought it made sense to cap it off with the \"Padawan Lost\"/\"Wookiee Hunt\" two-parter, despite being less connected to the main story.  We also get some nice early signs of Anakin's turn towards the dark side, especially in the really interesting \"Overlords\"/\"Altar of Mortis\"/\"Ghosts of Mortis\" arc, and a little bit in the arc after that when he says the Jedi don't go far enough in the war.  And this was also a great season for Asajj Ventress, who has a few good arcs.  Especially the \"Nightsisters\"/\"Monsters\"/\"Witches of the Mist\" arc, which may be my favorite arc of the series so far because of how unique it was with its perspective, and the dynamics at play.\n\n**The Dragon Prince season 3**\n\nI was thinking of waiting to talk about this show until I was caught up, but this is as good a time as any to do so.  I've really liked the show so far, with its gradual build-up of the main plot and character arcs.  And season 3 was did a great job pushing the story forward in different ways.  Ezran had some interesting growth, as >!He went back to become king, even if only temporarily.!<  I also liked both Callum and Rayla's character development this season as well.  And this being the end of the first arc, it ended on a pretty satisfying note, while setting some things up for the rest of the season.  I like how Claudia and Soren >!are on different sides now!<, with Soren in particular having some nice growth here.  And the last episode was a strong, exciting way to tie some of the threads up for now.\n\n**Vinland Saga season 1**\n\nThis was a great take on the Viking story.  I will say that while I liked Thorfinn early on, I'm glad the story shifted away from him a bit after a while, because he did start to become kind of one-note before too long.  But the rest of the story does a good job making up for it, with some other interesting character arcs.  And I liked the scale of the story, as we see the Viking conflict with other nations, mixed with some more personal conflicts among characters.  I am looking forward to seeing where they go in season 2, given where the story went at the end.",

The \"Get one.\" scene in the final episode gave me goosebumps. Followed up with the scene of Shoresy coming off his high as he starts limping again and realizes he is past his peak? It was beautiful.\n\n\nIf you watch or play hockey, you need to watch this show. It is written by and features actual hockey players for most characters. It feels so authentic.\n\nIf you like sports movies, watch this show. Each season feels like a standalone movie.\n\nAnd I know this comparison gets thrown around a lot, but if you liked Ted Lasso, go watch this. It's definitely more 'adult' orientated, but has a similar theme of not giving up and rallying a team/organization/community behind your efforts.",

S3 is decent and I'm looking forward to final season.\n\nOne thing I appreciate is that, while the kids might keep some secrets, Clark and Lois don't.

While there are some definite dips in quality in some of the later seasons, I really thoroughly enjoyed it, though I don\u2019t plan on watching the spin-off. I will definitely be watching whenever they drop the last season, though!\n- I was so pleasantly surprised with Matthew\u2019s character growth in the last couple seasons and so delighted with the progression of his family. It was perfectly subtle and incredibly realistic in the slow coming around to his homosexuality - >!his parents teaching his younger siblings about what \u201cgay\u201d means was very sweet.!< (Fuck Brittany though.)\n- Never would\u2019ve expected it, but my MVP of this watch was 100% Jay. Jason Mantazoukas brought the chaos, which I expected, but there was a sadness and a sweetness to Jay that made him really endearing. I remember thinking he was \u201ctoo much\u201d in my initial watch but I really enjoyed his storylines this go-around.\n- also wouldn\u2019t have expected my honorable mention to be Caleb, but especially in the most recent season, they did a beautiful job of giving him depth and making him one of the most realistic portrayals of neurodivergence I\u2019ve seen in media.\n\n**The Bear:** I only watched the first episode of season 3 because my two rules with this show are no binging and also not too close to bed, because this show makes me anxious and I can\u2019t sleep after watching it (or it gives me nightmares about my family, neither of which are pleasant). I\u2019ve seen this episode was pretty divisive, I personally loved it and it had me ugly crying. While it was a beautiful character study, it was also a really great portrayal of grief in many ways and Jeremy Allen White knocked it out of the park per usual. I\u2019ll get through more of it this weekend out of fear of having the season spoiled if I wait too long.",

Very much devolved into a sitcom at this point, and there's nothing wrong with sitcoms but I thought Hacks was trying to do something different.\n\nThe worst of it is how we repeatedly get these unfathomably cringe bits that are blatantly trying to make a metacommentary on the industry and zeitgeist but just. Reiterates the zeitgeist? instead of adding anything new at all. Very \"aha isn't hollywood so evil, fellow kids?\" or \"rich people are bad!

FX tends to do well with miniseries. \n\nWatched the premiere of **The Bear** and I get why people are saying the season is as pretentious as it is anemic. However I liked the minimal use of dialogue and the introspective angle given the events of the season 2 finale. While I have yet to catch the rest of the season, I refuse to believe it's the most unfocused mess of a season when The Morning Show's second season exists. \n\nI also finished **Route of Odd Taxi** which was a rather pleasant surprise. A spin-off (that also happens concurrently) of the Odd Taxi anime that got adapted into a live-action series, I was worried it would lose much of its uniqueness without the animal angle. It's rather straight-forward, albeit satisfying, mystery series. However it does not intersect or involve the majority of the subplots of the main series, and if you have not seen said series then it loses a lot of its appeal.",

I guess some people must find this cocktail of ultraviolence paired with cynicism appealing enough, but I just had enough.\n\nI'm also rewatching season 1 of **House of the dragon**, which is of course pretty good. This time around I'm including this parallel show, **The House that dragons built**, which made me think that we've really grown accostumed to quite spectacular standards of quality on our tv diet. It's bananas what this people manage to accomplish, the amount of geniuses working hand in hand in there. And Paddy Considine is extraordinary as Viserys. Talk about an Emmy snub.\n\nFinished **Sweet Tooth**. It was a bit of a chore to end this one. I thought the 3rd season was worse than the second, the second worse than the first. All in all, I found the tone rather interesting, with adult themes and others more connected to a younger audience. My favourite character was the mole kid.",

It's this kind of effective setup work that really gives the audience context and investment for what he must be feeling later on as things go topsy-turvy.  They also do a good job of building up the mystery and suspense before doing a reveal at the end that leaves the viewer really wanting to see more.\n\nI just think back to how they tried to set up the background for the main character and setting up the \"mystery\" in The Acolyte's opening episode, and it is night and day in their quality and effectiveness.

While I'm having some trouble placing Christon as a character, I'm starting to see him as a \"true knight\" in a satirical way. Like, he's a violent reckless moron, but someone gave him some shiny armor, so he gets to act poised and bully people \"for the realm,\" kinda like the knights in Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. He's not my favorite character, but I'm wondering if they are positioning him a bit like Jaime in early GoT.

            "body": "I don't usually make a second post in the same week, but I'll make an exception this time.\n\n**Star Trek Prodigy season 2**\n\nAfter season 1 completely won me over, becoming my personal favorite of the new shows, this became my most anticipated TV show overall.  Even more so after the issues since its cancellation/removal from Paramount+, the details from interviews and social media post by the writers, and initial feedback from those who saw the French release or reviewers who got it early.\n\nAnd now that I've binged it over the last couple days, I'd say it was more than worth the wait, living up to pretty much all of my high expectations, and doing so in very unexpected ways.  Now that eased people into the bigger Star Trek universe, its ideals and sci-fi concepts, they're holding *nothing* back.\n\nThis season is actually much more serialized that season 1, but not exclusively so.  After a few episodes, you start to see one-off episode ideas, which are often a lot of fun.  I'd say many of these are on par with the better ones from season 1 (and very solid by Star Trek standards in general).  And meanwhile, the serialized story ended up having a very complex plot by *any* standards, not just for \"kids\"/family TV.  Even as an adult, the concepts can get a bit dizzying, especially in the episodes that lean into them the most.  Though I do feel like the action and adventures are fun enough to captivate the younger viewers.  Same with the connections to the larger Star Trek franchise - goes very deep with it, in a way that can feel satisfying to long-time fans, but not alienating to newcomers.  And the best thing is, none of it feels forced and out of place.  It's all very natural with the threads from season 1 which they're following through from.  None of it takes away from the story of the new crew.  And there's not one returning character whose presence I question in the slightest, but rather adds to the greater picture.\n\nOne caveat:  In season 1, I've understood people's resistance to the character Dal in early episodes.  I even felt it myself at times, especially in the episode \"Starstruck.\"  But over the season, I felt like he had a great arc where he becomes a much more likable character (even if still sometimes flawed).  However, annoying Dal does come back again this season.  It's understandable given the change in his situation, and once again he gets better as the season goes along, having some pretty great moments in later episodes.  But it doesn't change how annoying some of his actions are early on.\n\nEven so, I'd strongly recommend this show to long-time Star Trek fans, newcomers to the franchise, fans of good sci-fi in general, and animation.  Each season is good good in its own way, with season 2 being on another level for me.",

Instead of pulling you in, they just pull you out because of how much they're used. It's like I am constantly reminded that I am watching something filmed on camera. However, the story is great and I feel the book gives me solid groundwork to appreciate the series even more. Happy to binge it in the coming days.\n\nStill a pity though that such an attention-seeking director brings the whole experience down. \"Hey look at me, I'm so cool for abusing trendy techniques that everyone else in the industry is using!\" And shame also on whoever in the chain of command gave the go to these idiotic stylistic choices.",

Which seems to be something that got more development in Gen V than it did in The Boys.\n\n**House of the Dragon S2E3:**\n\nOne of the worst episodes I have ever seen. The sexist writers keep ruining Alicent and Rhaenyra. Book Rhaenyra was so interesting but the show made her bland as can be. That final idiotic scene of the episode stands amongst the writing in S8. The entire episode is of S7 or S8 quality.\n\nThe biggest crime for these episodes though is that they are just plain boring.",

Has that 'prequelitis' feel of all the mediocre Star Wars stuff we've seen in the last decade and, as Andy Greenwald of The Watch podcast said, it feels like an expanded footnote from Game of Thrones. Lots and lots of long scenes of people talking in rooms as well. There's no White Walkers, no Free Cities, no Tyrion, no Varris, none of the great characters, big set pieces, and existential threats that made Game of Thrones so good. \n\nHopefully HBO decides to take on some new fantasy/SF IP soon and just doesn't just make prequel shows in this universe for the foreseeable future, and I say that as a Game of Thrones reader. This adaptation was the rare case where I hadn't read an adaptation of a famous sf/fantasy book beforehand, and I was looking forward to being surprised, but, oh well.\n\n**Hell's Paradise (Netflix)** \n\n8-part anime on Netflix that has a really interesting hook (samurai get sent to a strange seemingly pantheistic island full of dangerous creatures) that is faintly reminiscent of Kong: Skull Island or the Annihilation book/movie on the high end. Never quite lives up to that promise, unfortunately, with the usual endless boring boss fights that mark this sub-genre, but it's worth a quick watch if you just want to turn your brain off for a bit and like anime with a bit of a surreal twist.",

GOT was a sprawling epic featuring dozens of characters separated by entire continents and many parallel storylines, with a lot of time spent on mystery. It was a panorama, where HotD is more like a portrait or two, focused in tightly on a single conflict and a smaller cast. This may be an odd comparison but the difference feels like The Wire v. The Sopranos to me, in terms of one being kind of a large-scale view of an entire society and the other being a character study. They're so different it's tough to compare them and you don't expect one to scratch the itch of the other.\n\nI think it's especially tough to compare them at this point, since season 1 of HotD was more like a long prologue. It feels like we're only really 3-5 episodes deep into the show proper right now. Because the first 7 or so were just the intro.",
