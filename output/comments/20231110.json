            "body": "**The Knick**. Finished season 2. Overall really good and Soderberg's directing was good as ever, but not as great as Season 1, which was pretty much perfect. Season 2 I felt went a little too soap opera-y with some of the characters and they put Clive Owen's character kind of in the background. They introduced a little too much plot threads imo and I wish they focused more on the medicine and the main doctor characters. Amazing series finale though.\n\n**Patriot** \\- Been rewatching this, haven't watched it since 2018. Feels new as ever. I love the pacing of season 1 and how it unfolds the whole story, just great storytelling. Michael Dorman is amazing as John Lakeman. Great supporting cast too. Probably one of the most underrated shows ever.",

Disney should be looking at this and Andor as benchmarks of what their franchises can become if given the time and effort.",

Mizu being mixed race in a homogeneous society, and how that affects the way people view her, the way she views herself, and how it underpins her revenge quest I thought was one of the more compelling aspects of the show.",

            "body": "**For All Mankind S4 E1 (Apple TV)** \\-- One of my favorite sci-fi shows is back, and the season opener was great, but man, one of the main characters can never seem to catch a break. I just love this that fact this is such a weird show to describe: it's sci-fi but it's retro. It has futuristic space tech, but also evokes sense of nostalgia as each season jumps a decade from the late 60s to the 80s, to the 90s, to the 2000s, etc.\n\n**Lessons In Chemistry S1 E6 (Apple TV)** \\-- Still continuing to like this show, and Brie Larson is great as Elizabeth Zott, but her young daughter, Madeline, is also starting to win me over. She's been getting more screentime lately and she channels her mother's quirky and overly pragmatic way of looking at the world, but with a childlike innocence and joy. So adorable.\n\n**Blue Eye Samurai S1 E1 to E4 (Netflix) -**\\- I'm halfway through this new animated show, and this has been a pleasant surprise to me. I'm often disappointed with western portrayals of feudal Japan, since I'm Japanese American and can understand Japanese and watch a ton of Japanese media, but this show did its homework. The animation quality is spectacular, and I've been watching it with both the original English voice acting and the Japanese dub, and both are really good. I can't decide which one is better, so I sometimes rewatch an episode, switching to the other voice dub.\n\nI also love the more mature tone of the show. It's definitely not for kids as it doesn't shy away from nudity or violence. It reminds of the original cult-classic Heavy Metal movie, or Netflix's other animated show, Love Death + Robots, which was inspired by Heavy Metal.\n\n**Bosch Legacy S2 E9 & E10 (Amazon Prime)** \\-- I like how Amazon drops two episodes per week instead of one, and here we get the last two episodes of the season. Maybe not my favorite season of Bosch, but I still really enjoyed it.\n\nI wasn't expecting it, but the side character Mo, played by Stephen A. Chang, really shines in the finale. He plays a happy-go-lucky hacker with a love of jazz and beatnik-like fashion, and up till now, he has mainly provided some light comic relief to balance out the stoic Bosch. Here we see more of Chang's acting range as when he uses a game of Uno to confront a possible betrayal of a love interest, and it was the most intense game of Uno I've ever seen. Sounds funny, but Stephen A. Chang really killed it here, displaying such passion and emotion. I really hope next season the show continues to develop the Mo character and utilizes more of Chang's acting abilities.\n\n**Deadloch E1 and E2 (Amazon Prime)** \\-- Not sure about this show yet. I really like a lot of elements of the show, particularly the female main lead detective, but her other female partner seems like a goofy caricature. This show can make me laugh though so I'm continuing to watch it, but it hasn't quit hooked me in yet, however the mystery is ramping up so maybe it takes a while to get into the show.",

Hell, there\u2019s even social commentary.\n\nThe first two episodes where sailor-mouthed Eddie (the out-of-town detective) is at her most belligerent may put some people off, but sticking through it will reward you with a continued plot and a lot of fantastic insults and creative mixes of bad words and Australian slang.\n\nSimply put, it was a fun ride.",

Even without that duo this new series was compelling viewing with all the fast pacing and crazy shit that make the regular **The Boys** show such a fun watch. I liked the smaller scale stakes in the college set show and I found the new characters a pretty compelling and complicated bunch in their own right. Super impressed and glad we are getting more. Pretty much the perfect spinoff show. \n\nI\u2019m also still watching the **FBI** procedurals. At this point I think International is actually the best of the bunch though I definitely enjoy them all. \n\nNext up I should really get to one of a bunch of recently wrapped Apple shows I\u2019ve been meaning to get to (The Changeling, Invasion, Foundation, The Morning Show) or one of a bunch of recent Netflix animated shows (Dragon Prince, Akamai-Kun, Blue-Eye Samurai, Pluto, Castlevania, Onimusha, Good Night World, Captain Laserhawk) that I\u2019ve been meaning to try. Though I could also be tempted by the third season of **Upload** instead.",

I definitely captured The Boys vibe. \n\nYour point about the show having small stakes is also why I liked it too. One of the reasons why I liked the original Netflix Marvel shows was also because the stakes were also small, not on a global or even cosmic level like in the Marval movies, which I found really refreshing. \n\nHaving smaller stakes lets you relate to the characters more, and I think maybe that's why I found the characters in the show more likable, even the villains. The Boys is still more iconic show, but I think in some ways I may enjoy watching Gen V more because it hurts my brain less. LOL. But I really enjoy both shows.",

I almost want to write a horror story about the ghosts of the enslaved people that the Southern Aristocracy made their fortunes on haunting them and causing all this chaos and pain in their lives. Not saying people like Olivia \"deserve\" the pain of losing family members--no one does, but watching Shep, Craig, and Austen blow up their lives in slow mo and Whitney and Patricia bumble around their decaying mansion alone and lonely is some kind of horror show, for sure. \n\n**Real Housewives of Beverly Hills** on Peacock.

I don't dispute she's a terrible friend, wishy washy, etc. But something about her strikes a chord of recognition in me and I've always had a soft spot for her nonsense.

Almost a pure sci-fi story that just happens to star a known (and well-liked) Marvel MCU character and serves as a bit of background for the Big Bad in the upcoming MCU movies.  I loved everything about this series.  The story, the casting/acting, the music, the production/design.  It's just all great.  Can get a bit confusing at times but I don't think it really hurts it.  The confusing nature IMO adds a bit to the sense of chaos and things being out-of-control.\n\nI'm getting the feeling it's time to do a re-watch of HBO's Rome.  It's been a few years and that series is so epic.\n\nWondering what to watch next after that.  Everyone keeps praising certain shows but a lot of them turn out to be animated ones (like Blue-Eyed Samurai, Invincible), but for the most part I find myself not wanting to watch them because most of the animated shows in the past I have not found engaging in the way they tell stories.

I need to be in just the right mood to enjoy the banter. I found Martin Short's character's interactions with Mabel particularly annoying this season. For like the first half of the season I felt like I was just getting through the episodes and had a difficult time focusing on the show. I don't want to be overly critical because I got exactly the kind of show I expected after the first two seasons, but it was starting to feel pretty recycled at points. I did enjoy all the cameos, and felt the season ended on a very strong note. The last few episodes were much more captivating and enjoyable.\n\nI also finished season two of **Loki**. I really enjoyed season one (especially the finale) but actually struggled to get through the first episode of the new season. I was really worried it would go the way of The Mandalorian or The Witcher and try to do too much big picture storytelling instead of focusing on the main character. Halfway through I still had no idea where they were going with it, but they were actually building toward something and the second half of the season was just a lot of fun. There's always an issue in stories with time travelling and multiverses that choices and consequences don't really matter, but I felt this season flipped that a bit and built up a feeling of dread that at times was bordering on cosmic horror. And I guess how can you *not* talk about how awesome Ke Huy Quan was? I thought maybe he was just being shoehorned in, but his character won me over almost instantly and was great throughout.",

The writing and directing are as close to perfect as you will find in a miniseries-style project this year. Darla Contois does such heavy lifting as the lead, and the spirit of the project reminded me of Precious, in that it is an amalgam of real-life trauma, resistance and survival stories. Unfortunately, it airs on the PBS station in an area in which I am traveling at midnight on Sunday while some less substantial foreign dramas get prime time slots...hopefully, it will get more publicity before awards season, because the team definitely deserves some trophies.",

I\u2019m a series binger so 2 episode drops at a time is a bit of letdown but not the\u2026.end of the world.\n\nEmma Corrin plays Darby, an astute, intellectual hacker who inherited a penchant for examining the recently deceased from her coroner father. Like The OA, this series is ethereal without being over the top new age. \n\n\nDarby and her partner in crime, Kill Bill, (Harris Dickinson) are first introduced via a road trip backstory, which sets up the overarching plot without getting too into the weeds or creating confusion. \n\n\nThe story then moves into a new setting in a far flung location where viewers are introduced to a large group of characters of questionable integrity: who\u2019s good, who\u2019s not? Think **The White Lotus**.\n\nIn a nice little meta-touch for this post right here in our sub, Reddit is prominently featured and in true dystopian fashion, an Atwood quote is highlighted by douchey and smug (yet enigmatic) tech guru, Andy Ronson, (Clive Owen) during an intimate group meeting where all of our potential baddies are in attendance.\n\n\nHave I mentioned the fantastic score yet? No? It\u2019s excellent.\n\nThere\u2019s also a nice amount of romance  that, so far, hasn\u2019t veered off into cheesy territory and enough tension for me to rate this 9 fuckyeahs out of 10. I\u2019m a sucker for modern dystopian stories so I hope the rest of the episodes in this series live up to these first two.",

Absolutely looking forward to season 2 (and wondering whether I should watch *Columbo*)\n\n**Why Women Kill s2:** in the later half of the season, I got a bit of binge fatigue. It could've been shorter and tighter, but it's a minor complaint. It's still fun and colorful and a good type of silly. *Only Murders* fans would probably like this\n\n**Our Flag Means Death s2:** this show warms my heart. It's such a mood booster without becoming *Ted Lasso* levels of saccharine. They know when to hold back without being afraid of being sincere and vulnerable. I love how it's shot and blocked as well. It just feels like one of those shows people poured their hearts, souls, and skills into\n\n*Binging*\n\n**What We Do In the Shadows s5:** very intrigued by the Guillermo plot line\n\n**Candy**: oh, this is good.

What I loved most was the closings made me think about real life national and international issues. Any other shows like that?\n\nedit: Oh and I watched Law and Order. Don't care for the police part but loved the court stuff. I think I'll take up SVU. Heard it was more popular but I'm not really interested in sex crimes. I like the hospital negligence or therapist accidental murder stuff more. You know, complex. Bonus points that they're based on real life events too.",

It was a good documentary I\u2019d recommend.\n\nAlso finished: **The Billionaire, the Butler, and the Boyfriend** a 3 part French documentary on Netflix about the worlds richest woman Lilane Bettencourt who was the heir of the L\u2019Or\u00e9al fortune, which was her fathers company. The doc follows as her own daughter sues her to gain guardianship after she has been regularly gifting a photographer large sums of money and gifts. In the course of the legal case it\u2019s uncovered through secret recordings she has also been regularly supplying money to politicians including the French President at the time Sarkozy and committing Tax fraud.

The doc is quite interesting and the members discuss their attempts to acquire as many films as they could to watch which was quite difficult in 90s South Korea. It was also made difficult as the English titles weren\u2019t properly translated e.g. \u2018Raging Bull\u2019 was titled as \u2018Fist of Fury.\u2019 I\u2019d recommend if your a cinephile. \n\nYet to watch:\n* **One Piece s1.**\n* **Sex Education s4.**\n* **The Enfield Poltergeist (mini).**\n\nLooking forward to: **A Murder At The End Of The World (Mini).**",

Still finished it and thought it was a decent ride, despite some inconsistencies with the time traveling.\n\n**The Whale** (Prime): Thought this would be more of a tearjerker and was fully prepared to ugly cry, but it ended up just being somewhat sad. Brendan Fraser was great, but I expected more from Aronofsky on this one.\n\n**Blue Eye Samurai S1** (Netflix): Now this is my motherfucking jam!

While I found many aspects very predictable, I really liked seeing the team work and get a glimpse into the (however fictional) world of ultra-high-performing elite military ops/teams.\n\nI disliked the episode where the main female character is put through shocking prolonged \"conditioning\" it felt abusive and sadistic to me--so I'd prefer shows a bit more like 'The Night Manager' or 'Tyrant' --more glitzy, stylish, and perhaps even shallow than Hard Hitting stuff for Hard Core People.\n\nAny suggestions?

However, I will be the first person to admit the two shows are different in a number of ways.  Citadel is much flashier and has much more of a focus on the future, technology, etc.  That being said, I still enjoyed it very much.  Amazon spent a ton of money on the show, so there was a ton of hype for it, almost too much IMO.  Ironically, after initially not drawing the ratings that Amazon was hoping for, eventually the show did pretty well and was renewed for a second season.",

Why were they trying to say random quotes of wisdom constantly that make no sense? Ringo is so annoying and needs to be taken out of the show. The training montage with music that felt completely out of place was so cringe worthy. When she took the shackles off in the fight I was just confused.... what if he had chosen to kill her when he could before she has all 5mins to take the shackles off lmao. Not a fan of some of the voice acting too.\n\nThat being said at no point did I find myself bored. Corny but fun.\n\n**Episode 2:**\n\n>I do not deserve death by an impure hand.\n\n>Goodbye, bloadsoak Chiaki.\n\nI can't be the only one who laughed at that exchange.\n\nI enjoyed the episode but I think keeping Chiaki as a villain and continuing to build him up would be better especially when there was some hype for his group of 4.

            "body": "I have been watching a lot of animated shows this past couple months..\n\n* **Blue Eye Samurai (Netflix):** Probably the best animated show I've watched since Arcane. The 3D isn't as high quality as Arcane, but I found the writing, acting, and story a lot more compelling than Arcane. The characters are very well-written. The villains were especially deplorable. Fowler, in particular. That Irish bastard stole every scene he was in. \n\n   The show has great prose and is very poetically and intelligently written. There were many moments where I expected a character to overlook a detail or follow a clich\u00e9, but didn't. It's also refreshingly unapologetic about nudity, sex, or violence, but handled differently than other mature shows that often incorporate mature themes for cheap thrills or shock value. I could tell Blue Eye Samurai was striving to be authentic to the time period. The only other animated media that depicted old Japan as convincingly for me was 1999's Rurouni Kenshin OVA Trust & Betrayal\u2014and perhaps the 2021 live-action version of the same. (Of course, Kenshin is set during the 19th century, and Blue Eye Samurai during the 17th.)\n\n   I do have some complaints about the story. Mizu's life purpose of >!devoting all her energy and time to finding and killing four random white men who may or may not be her father, is somewhat absurd. Even Fowler comments on how statistically foolish her plight is, so at least the writers are self-aware. That said, Mizu clearly has psychological issues that seem like they will eventually be addressed, so I'm hoping this current revenge plot is a temporary phase until Mizu conquers her \"inner demons\".!< Also, the ending with >!Mizu taking Fowler prisoner (somehow) and apparently setting off for London on an acquired ship (somehow),!< felt a bit too out of left field, but I trust the writers will provide explanations, as the show has been good at backtracking and explaining ambiguous events.\n\n* **Pluto (Netflix):** I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this one compared to most its fanfare. The first few episodes were great to me, but then it started to drag, and by the end I was eager for it to be over. It was overall enjoyable, though.\n\n* **Invincible S2 EP1 (Amazon):** So far so good. The running gag with the Invincible title screen was hilarious. Though I'm disappointed that there will only be four episodes this year..\n\n* **Castlevania Nocturne (Netflix):** I didn't enjoy it as much as Netflix's first Castlevania series, but that's not saying much because it was still very awesome and I love everything Castlevania. Still, none of these new characters are as compelling as Isaac. I miss Isaac. :( At least >!Alucard's SotN look is awesome! !<\n\n* **Shingeki no Kyojin Series Finale:** I've been following this series since the manga began. It's hard to believe that it's finally over. I loved the final episode, except for the ~~anime-original~~ credits.. >!The last scene with Mikasa was touching, but then they soured it with the clich\u00e9 apocalypse. Was it too much to ask for a beloved, long-running series to be say farwell on a bittersweet ending? This series wasn't exactly short on human suffering. I already see the meme: \"Yo dawg, herd you like apocalypses so we added an apocalypse after your 80% human genocide apocalypse so you can apocalypse while you apocalypse.\" !<\n\n* **Kengan Ashura Season 2 (Netflix):** The fight choreography in this anime is always a delight. Though, I wish it was more consistent with the 2D vs 3D. I would prefer the show to be entirely 3D, since the 2D quality isn't anything special, and switching scenes between the two is jarring. I was disappointed that Ohma wasn't present for most of the season, but the fights were still awesome, and I'm looking forward to next season.",

Comedy/Drama about-middle age Manhattanites struggling with marriage, kids, jobs, status and money. Great perfomances, witty writing and a narrative voiceover that really works to translate the interior monologues of the characters from the novel this show was adapted from. I'm of the age the characters are so this probably hits harder than it might for others but I really thought this was excellent.\n\n**Devil's Hour** (Amazon Prime) There seems to be a lot of British shows like this: a mish-mash of detective story, light horror, thriller and romance with ideas liberally borrowed from a dozen different Hollywood movies. And, for me, they never seem to coalesce into anything interesting past the initial setup. Bounced off of this one after three episodes, although my wife finished it.\n\n**Pluto**(Netflix) I keep on hoping for SF animes to grab me like Akira or Ghost in the Shell but I'll keep on waiting after this one. Only got one episode in but was already fast-forwarding through some very tedious dialogue scenes and won't watch the rest.\n\n**Upload Season 3**(Amazon). Really liked this one after the first season but, boy howdy, has it gone downhill after a fun inital setup centering around people's conciousnesses getting uploaded into a virtual world. Its elevated the anti-capitalist subtext to a ludicrously corny full text and also suffers from the common problem of the main couple getting together, removing the central tension of the show.

It\u2019s a horror anthology show and I watched the first two episodes. \n\nWhile I appreciate that the show seems to be attempting to tackle complex issues the execution is a total miss for me. \n\nThe first episode centers on a serial killer coming to a small town and encountering a young waitress who seems stuck in her life and regrets the choices she\u2019s made, most of all getting pregnant at a young age. \n\nThe second is about a lonely guy who spends his time taking care of his sick mother and playing video games with friends online. He sees a \u201cshadow person\u201d in his room and seeks out help with dealing with it  from a group of experts online. \n\nIn both episodes there\u2019s some weighty subjects being addressed but in both cases there\u2019s too many things going on to have any meaningful impact and the \u201chorror\u201d element muddles whatever point was the show was trying to make.\n\nThe first one is especially frustrating because it had the potential to be interesting but rather than the profundity that it seems to think it has it ends up being nonesenical.\n\n This was a big disappointment and I really don\u2019t see myself watching any more episodes.",
