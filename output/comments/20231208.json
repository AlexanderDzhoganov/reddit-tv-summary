Bear with me, as I don't understand python AT ALL, but the code they left was pretty straightforward and I think I have it working for me. I found u/grubster11 's weekly summary extremely helpful and thus wanted to keep it going both for my own selfish purposes and for anyone out there that might also be missing their weekly comments. I ran this last week as a test, that's why there is data for consecutive weeks and comment gain. Lastly, to u/grubster11: rest easy, friend, your good work is carried on. \n\nShows from last week's [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/188fcjl/what_are_you_watching_and_what_do_you_recommend/?q=shrinking&type=comment) mentioned in at least 10 comments:\n\n|**Show**|On|Comments|Upvotes|Consec.

I\u2019ve really missed these ever since the last person stopped.  \n\nJust a reminder for everyone: a show being mentioned enough to make the list doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s good. I saw Beacon 23 on the list and I remembered being mildly interested when it came out (I\u2019m a huge sucker for sci-fi) but read middling/negative comments so I decided to wait and then completely forgot about it. Seeing it made the list I figured I\u2019d check it out again, so I looked through last weeks thread and had to scroll quite a ways to find any mention of it. Every comment I saw was talking about how people aren\u2019t enjoying it and that it feels like it was written by ChatGPT, so I\u2019ll definitely be skipping it. \n\nAnyways, just make sure that you don\u2019t start watching something only because it was mentioned a lot since they aren\u2019t always positive mentions.",

The mystery this season showcased was pretty good but upon first viewing can feel a little thin. It's only in the finale that its depth is unraveled and concludes with a memorable and relevant social commentary. Sucks that this show was cancelled but is still a must-watch for those who enjoy the true crime genre.\n\n**Teenage Bounty Hunters**: This is a show I thought I would never enjoy but here I am, a few hours after watching the finale wishing there were more seasons. Why did Netflix cancel this too soon? Anyways, TBH is quite an interesting teen show in my opinion. It is quite satirical and starts just like any other teen show does with all the high-school drama and whatnot for the first 5 episodes but changes direction and takes an unexpected route with the next 5. Despite the finale ending with massive twists, I feel like the writers had wrapped up the story leaving room for further continuation if it had reached there. This certainly is not a show for all but I'd highly recommend it to those looking for something entertaining to watch over the weekend.\n\n**Rick and Morty (S07E08):** I didn't like this episode but I did laugh at a few instances.",

The doc follows the police\u2019s investigation into finding the mother of the baby in the small town nearby. The doc reveals a corrupt police investigation with confessions gained through beating and threat. It also reveals a 2023 re-opened investigation in which the parent\u2019s of said baby are confirmed by the police through DNA. It was an interesting watch I\u2019d recommend watching it.\n\nAlso watched: **Seeds of Deceit: The Sperm Donor Doctor** a 3 part doc from the Netherlands about a fertility doctor who used his own sperm to inseminate his patients. The documentary follows the women who were deceived and the \u201cchildren\u201d of the doctor. It\u2019s a very bizarre doc with some of the children not minding that their mothers were deceived. One actually claims \u201cat least he was a doctor\u201d and some of the kids claim they think of him as their father over the father\u2019s that raised them. I\u2019d recommend giving it a watch but some of those kids have very stupid reactions to the situation. \n\nAlso watched: **Great Photo, Lovely Life** a HBO doc-movie which follows a photo-journalist Amanda Mustard addressing the well known \u201csecret\u201d in her family that her grandfather abused a number of different children in the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. The doc follows Amanda having talks with various family members mostly her mother and and her half-sister who have a very difficult relationship after Amanda\u2019s half sister was abused after the two moved in with her grandfather and grandmother as they had no where to live. I\u2019d recommend this doc even though it is a difficult watch at times. \n\nYet to Watch: \n* **Sex Education s4.**\n* **Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God (mini).**\n* **Murder in Boston: Roots, Rampage, and Reckoning (mini).**",

The animation is similar to **Arcane** and the art is absolutely beautiful. I found myself watching scenes and entire episodes over just to take it all in. The voice cast is top notch as well. I can\u2019t say enough about it. Must watch. \n\nI\u2019m on an animation jag. Any recommendations for other shows I need to catch? I liked **Arcane**, **The Last Avatar**, **Scavenger\u2019s Reign**, and **Pantheon**. **Love, Death, and Robots** is pretty good but I\u2019m more into longer story arcs.

The creature plus a couple of specific scenes made the whole show for me. That thing was so endearing but also unbelivably unsettling. I will be eagerly waiting for a second season. \nThis was my favourite binge. \n\n**Blue Eyed Samurai**\nI enjoyed it a lot, but not as much as scavenger\u2019s reign. There was one episode that stood out above the rest and really elevated the season, but there was a bit of tonal inconsistency that made me not love it. The episode at the castle felt like a video game level, whereas other episodes felt very realistic. I\u2019d definitely watch a second season though. \n\n**The Crown** \nI fell off the Crown the season before this one, caught up and then finished the new season. I do love me some period drama (even though we\u2019re into the 90s now) and the Crown is great for scratching that itch! The episode leading up to Diana\u2019s crash was really great, it had a very palpable feel of claustrophobia and chaos. \n\nDocumentaries:\nI used to watch like.. every new documentary that came out, but lately I\u2019ve been into fiction. However, I had a weird few days where I got really into watching some cult documentaries! \n\n**Love Has Won**\nThis cult is so crazy, it was very entertaining watching their insanity. I had never heard of them before at all and I was enthralled. This was like\u2026 beyond Tiger King level of crazy. Definitely recommend. \n\n**Escaping Twin Flames**\nComing off of Love Has Won made this one a bit a letdown. The leaders were just\u2026 assholes and I found it more difficult to really understand the appeal of this cult. At least the Love Has Won people were doing a lot of drugs. I finished it, but I wasn\u2019t as invested. \n\n**The Deep End**\nThis one is about Teal Swan and unlike the Twin Flames doc, after watching I understood why people would get sucked into this\u2026. But my god, she is so unbelivably narcissistic. This one was very cinematic, which was nice, but I felt like I was missing straight up information that would\u2019ve made it better. \n\n\nWeekly: \n\n**Murder at the End of the World**\nI\u2019m still enjoying every new episode, but being a huuuuge fan of the OA\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s living up to my very high expectations for these writers. Some of the character decisions are kind of puzzling. None the less, I\u2019m still very much enjoying the theorizing and mystery. \n\n**Monarch**\nI started out being SO hype about this show, but it has faded a bit since the first few episodes. I actually think the character drama is really well done - I\u2019ve seen many critiques of the modern day cast being insufferable and I don\u2019t agree. But I think I\u2019m starting to realize that what I want from the Monsterverse is\u2026 well, monster mayhem, lol. I watch other shows for character drama, I want this show to be for popcorn spectacle. So while I do think it\u2019s well done and I typically enjoy that, it\u2019s just not really what I\u2019m looking for from this. In a show about Monarch, I wanted to learn about the behaviour/biology/evolution of Gojira/other titan species, but we haven\u2019t gotten a lot of that. \n\n**For All Mankind**\nThis is a show where I\u2019m so invested in the characters after all these season that I truly don\u2019t watch for the space spectacle, I love it regardless. It continues to be great. I want more Soviet screen time pls. \n\n**The Gilded Age**\nAgain - love me some period drama. I loved Downton Abbey, I love the Gilded Age. I watched the first season when it came out and the first couple of episodes felt a bit off and I didn\u2019t really get obsessed with it. I totally forgot about it in the meantime, couldn\u2019t really remember for the life of me what happened, so I decided to rewatch the first season and oh baby! I am OBSESSED. It better get renewed!! \nThis is my favourite weekly show right now.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for other period dramas worth watching, I\u2019d love to hear them!",

The characters are really interesting and I absolutely love what Masi Oka brings to the table. The main premise of the story isn't anything that original but it's definitely fun and I really like how they execute it.\n\nUnfortunately the episode that is obviously supposed to be the best episode of the season just didn't land for me. Maybe it's the fact that I don't watch a lot of anime but I also had a difficult time consolidating how most stuff in the show is presented in a realistic way yet the samurai's abilities are so superhuman in the way that is normal in anime. It's like the real world rules apply to everyone except the main character. And like the samurai is obviously dealing with a lot of internal strife but in terms of external conflict there isn't really anything that they struggle with or have to overcome (at least in my opinion). They have so much plot armor and it's like all the severe setbacks they encounter have minimal or no consequences a scene or two later.\n\nI don't mean to nitpick so much because I genuinely did enjoy it, I just felt like since they clearly weren't going for a gritty realism vibe that they could have leaned into the fantastical side a bit more. That's all. I thought the first four episodes were really tight and I really liked parts of six and seven but it didn't end that strongly for me. I will enthusiastically watch a second season if we get one. I'd say 8/10 influenced by its potential and ready to go higher with a good second season (if we are so lucky).",

Overall this season gives me the feel of Unforgiven and Samurai Champloo.  And I look forward to see what they do with the story going forward.\n\nAlso watched **Scott Pilgrim Takes Off**.  I liked the comics and the movie but I mostly watched this because it was set in Toronto.  I appreciate how much they referenced Toronto, which the comics did as well even though the comics called out very specific locations, while this show didn't really.  Though it feels weird watching a modern show that was still using the original shows time period (rip Honest Eds).  The story was much more complex than the original which kind of makes it weird that they kept all the surreal elements to it, it's hard to do a murder mystery when people change into currency when they die.

Seasons start slow but you can see all the pieces coming together, really awesome!\n\nOn the opposite side, **Scavenger Reign** was pretty but that's it?

Okay, this show is crass, crude, gross, boorish, ridiculous, has FULL DONG NUDITY, features a drug-induced evil gremlin hallucination character, and people routinely and unironically chant \"USA! USA!\"...and I laughed out loud at least once an episode if not more. It's just fun, dumb, over the top tv that goes bang and winks at the audience. The few twists were solid. It's honestly well-written in that the plotting is tight, it all comes together seamlessly, and if something is shown in Scene \"A\" it comes into play a few scenes later in a clever way. \nThis is also very minor, but I appreciated the distinct focus on safer sex--the sex scenes showed condom use as part of the plot which you NEVER see on tv. Way to go, show! \n\n**Trial 4** on Netflix--like all Netflix mini series, it could have easily been shorter, but I'm only on episode 2 and it's well done so far. \n\nFinished up **Halt and Catch Fire** on AMC+. What a show! It left a show-hole I'm not sure I'll ever fill. This is my second try with this show--a few years ago I tapped out late in episode 1 but I absolutely devoured it this time around. I want every single thing in Donna's 80s apartment and all her clothes.\n\n**Black Cake** on Hulu (I think?) a *gorgeous* show. It's a little...treacly and reminds me strongly of \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" in many ways, but it's well-done. If you like period pieces and gentle, sentimental family stories with a touch of thriller/mystery you'll like this.",

Season 3 is my favorite.\n3. The Gilded Age season 2\n4. For All Mankind Season 4. I actually binge all 3 seasons in the last 2 weeks and love all of them even season 3 where some here said was the worst. The problem with this show though is with each new season they advance around a decade and you have to get use to new characters and new storyline. Your beloved character either exit the show or go to a place where you do not like. Hence I am watching the episodes very slowly. I do not like the new characters as much. No doubt though the show is definitely worth watching especially if you love space and good production values.\n5. Monarch Season 1. I am behind but I will catch up soon.\n\nAlso watching some weekly  competition reality shows\n\nSurvivor 45 - I think it is the best season in the new era.\n\nThe amazing Race 35\n\nShark Tank 15\n\nSurvivor UK S3 (reboot) - Feels like old school survivor if you miss the old survivor, you would like this.\n\nWas looking for something fun and started Obliterated.

I'm still not entirely buying Hamm as a bastard, the guy is just too wholesome.\n\nI watched the first episode of **Scavangers Reign**, which was quite mesmerizing. It reminded me of some 70's European animation, namely Fantastic Planet or The Masters of Time.\n\nLast night I also started this docuseries titled **Shadow of a wheel**. The premise might not sound like much (a bunch of kids in the early 80's travel across the US in bike to raise awareness for MS) but it's really compelling so far.\n\nI watched a couple of episodes of the 3 part docuseries **John Lennon: Murder without a tria**l. It's kind of sad. Also, I didn't enjoy having to listen to *that* individual, that I found disturbing. Might not finish it.",

There are some chilling moments with wonderful dialogue and characters who face complicated moral dilemmas. Even the side characters are all unique individuals with their own back stories and agendas.\n\n**Mandalorian** is somewehat less serious, but I don't know anyone who didn't enjoy the first two seasons. Again, you don't really need to know much about Star Wars to enjoy a rogue bounty hunter going on weekly adventures.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend *Kenobi* and *Ahsoka* to non-fans.\n\nI think the Marvel shows require you to be more of a fan. *Loki* might be the most interesting for casual fans, just because of how distinctive the design and vibe of the whole show is. *She-Hulk* might be the easiest for a non-Marvel fan to watch, but I haven't seen all of it.",

Netflix just has the ability to bring animated shows to an audience that most anime and animation could never reach because they think it's weird or for kids and would never give it a chance. Which is why shows like this that are just okay do so well because people have low expectations. I guarantee if some of the people who have been hyping Blue Eye Samurai so much watched something like Attack on Titan or Jujutsu Kaisen they would see how it pales in comparison.",
