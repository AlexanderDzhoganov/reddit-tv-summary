I'm sad that Netflix has promoted it as a miniseries, even though Zaillian's original plan with Showtime (before they canned it unaired so Netflix could buy it) was to attempt adapting all five of Patricia Highsmith's \"Tom Ripley\" novels. Which is why John Malkovich popped up in with such a tiny role (that character becomes much more central in the second book).",

They're not at all similar, just some more one of a kind shows, that are probably not for everyone but hopefully those that are into it will love them. There's a lot of different types of anime out there and usually only the mainstream ones ever get mentioned, so a lot of people think anime is all just like demon slayer, attack on titan, naruto etc. Also these are only 12 episodes (20 minutes each).\n\n**Mononoke** (2007 series on Netflix) - really unique art style kind of like woodblock art, very colorful. It was recently remastered so I could finally watch it in good quality when it came to netflix. Definitely a classic. It's basically short stories about a guy who exorcises demons by discovering the circumstances of the curse. I really love the Japanese voice actor for the MC, if you're willing to watch subs (and I want dubs plenty so I'm not a sub snob) but it has a dub as well. It was based on a 3 episode arc from a show called Ayakashi Japanese Classic Horror (eps 9-11) although those episodes aren't on Netflix. And there's a new movie coming out next month for the 15th anniversary that looks [drop dead gorgeous.](https://youtu.be/0x-SryQQmRs)\n\n**Sonny Boy** (Hulu) - this is one of those trippy confusing shows with a non-linear timeline. It's about kids that end up in an alternate world/reality in a sort of Everything Everywhere All at Once sort of way. It has amazing cinematography, everything was very intentional and thought out. It's full of metaphors and symbolism that I'd go read people's thoughts after each episode to understand wtf just happened. It's really about the journey, not explaining why or how they're in this situation because that's not important, and thus there's a lot of time jumps. At the end of the day it's just a coming of age story about them experiencing these weird things as a metaphor for growing up. It's so unique and I was just so engrossed in it.\n\nI actually have quite a lot more great unique anime I could mention, but idk if anyone is even gonna care or read this lol.",

It's a fine line to walk between intriguing and gripping the audience, and frustrating the audience, making them lose investment in what's happening because none of it could be what actually happened, and so far the show has succeeded at the former. \n\nThis episode in particular showed some of the most important scenes of season one through Lestat's POV and seeing just how different things went down compared to what we initially shown is just fascinating. Now we don't know if Lestat's recollection of events are what actually happened, but it is implied they are much closer to the truth than Louis' recollection, which has been so heavily tainted by emotions, time, his mental health and possibly having his memory modified by Armand. And showing that Louis is still hallucinating Lestat in Dubai shows that what we've been seeing of Dubai may not be as objective as the audience was lead to believe, which is rather intriguing.",

But you can always check out the original film.  The show is a \"retelling\" of the original story where the interviewer is called back as an older man to be told the \"true story\" of events that took place from when he first became a vampire in the early 1900s to now.\n\nI've read the books and saw the original film in theaters and I think the show is a very great adaptation even if they made some changes to the timeline and characters.",

It's wild to know she was only fifteen-years-old while filming it, because she was already a pretty great actor. \n\nI'm surprised by the amount of mature subjects the show has touched on in just a few episodes. This aired on ABC in 1994, and was a show ostensibly for teens, so it's wild to think they let this air (but then maybe it's also the reason it didn't last beyond one season). \n\nI'll say that having to watch Jared Leto is a bit of a negative, and so far his character is kind of an asshole. But who knows, maybe he'll have some kind of redemption arc that will make him more tolerable.\n\nBut overall, I'm really enjoying it, and I'll be sad when all nineteen episodes are over. I'm trying to remind myself that nineteen episodes is kind of the modern-day equivalent of 2.5 seasons, so that I'll feel less sad when there's no more.\n\n---\n\n**Can I get some recommendations for maybe 1990s\u20132000s coming-of-age dramedy series that are similar?** (Already watched ***Freaks & Geeks*** last year, which I loved.)",

So much so that I am actually having trouble telling if it is really bad or if I'm just being thrown off by some issues.  The main issue is that the scenes feel like they are cut off too soon and so things they are trying to convey/develop are incomplete and the audience does not have time to digest it.  It also makes the dialogue feel very weird and unnatural.  And the way they handled the cliffhanger was to reveal enough to break up a lot of the built up tension, which is the opposite of what a cliffhanger is supposed to do.  Very strange.\n\nThis show kind of makes me think of dancing the waltz but it is not in the proper 3/4 time, and so it always throws you off.",

The other supporting characters were great:  Nick, Perez, the good-looking fella from Jury Duty; it's just that whoever directed Michelle didn't think to say, \"Hey, uh, dial back the male gaze a bit.\"  Also, if you're a fan of Married with Children, there is a very surprising near-reunion to be had in the penultimate episode.\n\n5/5, actually funny women to be found here.",

One about Morgan Elsbeth (who appears in Mandalorian and Ahsoka) and how she goes from Nightsister to working with >!Thrawn!<. Was a sad story about how one can turn from oppressed to oppressor. Only complaint is in the first episode an older woman who is in charge of a village >!tells the people not to worry about getting attacked and to trust her but gives no details. This is after genocide of the Nightsisters nearby. Since she provides no safety or ideas others start training for defense in secret which then backfires when the droids attack only to reveal that the old lady could defend and had a plan the whole time...then the show acts as if she was in the right and everyone else should have trusted her and were wrong to go against her.!< This was just like in the Last Jedi when Admiral Holdo >!refused to communicate with her team, everyone goes against her since she gives off that she has no plan, then it is revealed she had a plan all along and the show acts like everyone else was in the wrong for not trusting her.!<\n\nThe second arc follows Barriss Offee and follows up from Clone Wars where she was >!arrested for murder if I remember correctly? This one is a nice contrast as the arc is kind of opposite showing her redemption arc. However, at the end the show seems to show the Fourth Sister being redeemed which is hard to accept given her genocide of civilians earlier in the show.!<\n\nWould recommend.",

The effect is to make the action mean only a fraction of what it should because the audience doesn't have the same kind of emotional investment into the whole thing.\n\nSo with Andor it builds up so much meaning and that makes the action payoff have far more value.  Other SW shows fall into the trap of rushing us from scene to scene and then giving us so much action but without a good build up and so the payoff has little effect.  Quality vs quantity.",

I've been enjoying the acting and the action a lot more than the story this season.\n\nI've been loving the return of **House of the Dragon**. It really scratches the itch for me. How far we have come from the end of the D&D days of Game of Thrones. Rhys Ifans as Otto was hilarious in episode two. Maybe as much or more than the show itself, I've been enjoying the supporting Alt Shift X content about the show and the book lore.",

The last episode set things up nicely for the finale.\n* **The Boys:**  Not as strong a story as in years past, it feels a bit wheel-spinning / table-setting thus far, although the last episode was probably the strongest of the season.\n* **The Acolyte:**  It seems like there is a conscious effort on Disney's part to start these episodes with runtimes of 50 to 60 minutes before ratcheting them way down.  Last week's half hour was particularly egregious, weirdly paced and with a badly timed cliffhanger.\n\n***Finished***\n\n* **Outer Range:**  We're getting to this point with this show where I'm going to need some flow charts to help keep thing straight.  I'm not sure I'm that invested, to be honest.  It feels like we've gone two seasons now without any real payoffs.\n\n***On Deck***\n\n* **The Bear:**  We have a camping trip scheduled for this weekend.

After finishing it earlier this week, I think not all of the 6 actually had schizophrenia. But after the eldest and 1st brother was diagnosed, when the younger brothers began to misbehave/act-out as teenagers the parents especially the mother were quick to rush to say they were also schizophrenic as a cause for their behaviour. Overall, I would recommend the documentary.\n\nFinished Binging: **The Accidental Twins**, a doc-movie on Netflix about two sets of identical twins who were switched at birth in Colombia. The discovery of the switch occuring 25 years later.\n\nAlso finished: **Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini**, a 3-part documentary on Hulu about the disappearance of a Californian mom whilst out jogging in 2016. After 22 days she is found alive, claiming she was held by two Mexican women. But the police and FBI, begin to poke holes in her story.

Lighthearted, well-written and lovable characters, nice character arcs, short episodes, and a fantastic soundtrack. The show is charming af, and if it wasn't ~50/50 in spanish/english most of the time I'd say it'd be one of their more popular shows.

            "body": "The Bear S2\n\nDid I miss a scene where Carmy stole the clock from his group therapy in the opening of E3?  Because the literal exact same clock was in The Bear's kitchen starting in E9, or at least that's when I started to really notice it.  Smart of the production crew to save money by reusing props I guess.  Found it kind of odd towards the beginning of that episode where Sydney's dad is wearing his work shirt with his name on it while chilling at home offering his daughter a coffee and offers for her to \"live here forever\".  Literally no one does this at all in the real world.  Normal people tend to wait until right before they clock in before shrugging themselves into their work shirt, and normal people don't let their adult children keep living with them.  But I guess the prop department REALLY NEEDED to let me know that Emmanuel's not only a hard-working blue collar man, but also sensitive too!  Ostensibly idealistic and heart-warming, but ultimately damaging when impressionable viewers tries to apply this takeaway to the real world and have reality shit down their fucking necks.  edit:  Just saw the S3E4 synopsis saying that she's getting her own apartment so I guess my outlook was correct as always.  God, it's so tiring being right all the time!\n\nAlso, I remember the thread that someone linked me to which was my first time visiting reddit which was about The Handmaid's Tale and its extensive number of close-ups on monologuing faces.  Reason why that sprung to mind was because I feel like the same crew is doing this show, too.  Awful lot of facial close-ups, and it makes me feel like they're working around the fact that the actors are either not in the same room together or having to do a lot of reshoots.\n\nThe \"Fishes\" episode was a pleasant banger!  I had just sat down to eat some Pizza Luce with a glass of wine and paid NO attention to the runtime.  Imagine my shock when the credits rolled and I jiggled my Magic Mouse to see that a whole hour had passed!  Loving the surprise cameos in that episode.  Can't wait for S3!",
