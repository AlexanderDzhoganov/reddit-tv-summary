Just an absolute delight to revisit Oldman and co. Love the \u2018what if John Le Carre but fuckups?\u2019 premise. If you\u2019re sleeping on this one, get at it. The six episode seasons don\u2019t leave any room for streaming bloat. \n\nFinished season 14 of **Great British Bake Off**. Solid season that ended with a bit of a thud. A year with no real consistent, high level standouts made the finale a bit duff. Any of the three finalists could have taken it as they were fairly even and no one really knocked it out of the park. I did appreciate that they made the challenges more normal this year, and booting Matt Lucas was the right choice.\n\nNearing completion of the latest season of **Bosch: Legacy**, which has picked up after a pretty weak start.

The series takes a look at key situations that most adults have been through while putting them in a context that feels fresh. Mr. Crook may be guilty of a bit of viewer manipulation by depicting the main characters as meek and sometimes naive who face bullies and mocking. This is easily forgiven, though, because of the stellar cast that makes every persona feel real, believable, and truly likable. Apart from that, each character down to the smallest role has something unique that sets them apart. There is wisdom to be found here, and peace, if you have the patience. Sometimes life tosses you a gold coin and sometimes a ring pull - just go with it, it will balance out it in the end. A true dramedy gem.",

            "body": "**The Squid Game: The Challenge (Netflix)** \\-- I had no intention of watching this reality TV show, even though I really liked the original drama, but my uncle wanted to watch the first episode, and somehow, I got hooked and watched all the available episodes on my own in two nights. It's not my favorite competition-based reality TV show, but despite some criticisms, it was entertaining enough to watch -- and holy cow -- the prize money is INSANE: *4.5 million dollars!* Not even Survivor at its most popular offered that much money. Too bad we have to wait another week for the finale.\n\n**Only Murders in the Building S1 & S2 (Hulu)** \\-- I wish I had started watching this earlier. I binged both seasons in one week and about to start the third. I love the cast, and I'm feeling my age as I get many of the older pop-culture references mentioned by Martin and Short. I loved how the show plays with the mystery genre, sometimes breaking the 4th wall, or having an unexpected side-character start an episode as the main narrator. Conversely, the no-dialogue episode with no narration was also really good.\n\nI'm so happy they let Steve Martin show some of his music-playing ability. I'd love to see him and Selena Gomez perform a music routine, maybe have him play the accordion like he did for Bernadette Peters in the classic scene from the Jerk (except not as a serenade to the younger Gomez because that would be too weird).\n\n**Fargo S5 E3 (Hulu)** \\-- A slower episode than the first two but it laid the groundwork for what should be an explosive episode next week: a crazy home invasion episode. I see people not liking the touch of the surreal/supernatural in this episode, but to me, it really captures the Coen Brother's universe, as we saw similar surreal elements in many of their other their movies, like in Barton Fink. Creator Noah Hawley really does an excellent job at channeling the full range of the Coen Brothers' aesthetic into this show.\n\n**For All Mankind S4 E4 (Apple TV)** \\-- Surprisingly, in this episode, I was more into the Soviet Union plotline that was full of intrigue, rather than the sci-fi plotline of the Mars base. I just really love the Margo character, played by Wrenn Schmidt, and it's so nice to see Margo back in her element, doing what she does best, despite being a stranger in a strange land. Wrenn plays her so well that I sometimes forget that Wrenn is many decades younger than the now-grey-haired Margo.  She plays her so convincingly.\n\n**Slow Horses S3 E1 & E2 (Apple TV)** \\-- One of my favorite mystery/spy shows is back and uncharacteristically, this season begins at a really frantic pace. This show is usually a slow burn, but things get moving fast with a disappearance of a key character. It's great to see Gary Oldman reprising his role as the foul-mouthed, and very foul-smelling, leader of a group of misfit British agents.\n\n**Monarch S1 E4 (Apple TV)** \\-- Lots of monster action in this episode which was great to see. Kurt Russell was good, but I also missed seeing the older crew from the 50s timeline. I don't know what's up with the Kentaro character, but at least we get to see the softer side of him with the flashbacks of him and Mai getting together.  It's way more fun to see them when they are having fun, so why do both of them have such sour faces all the time in the present timeline?",

I like the slow process of trying to solve the mysteries. \n\nAlso check out Bosch Legacy when you're done. I think the main show is still better, as they really had to slim down the budget for Legacy, but if you're a fan of Bosch, I think you'll still enjoy it. It's like comfort food for me so I still like it. I also like some of the new characters they introduced in Legacy. One of them really gets to shine in the later half of S2 of Legacy.",

I definitely gravitate towards a lot of kinda weird and unique anime so this fulfills that for me. I've seen some criticism saying the plot is lacking/boring and has bad writing. Obviously not everyone is gonna be drawn into it and that's fine, but they act like it's an objectively bad show because the writers choose to focus on other aspects rather than have constant action and plot twists.\n\nWhile I love a good plot, I don't think it's the only thing that matters. Often I'll love a show more because of the world building, characters, and general vibe. I even saw someone say it's just a turn your brain off show, which is wild to me cuz all the episode comments are constantly creating theories and analyzing symbolism.\n\nRegardless, this show totally drew me in and I've seen plenty of praise for it, but I understand if that's not true for everyone. Hopefully some of those that loved it and were hesitant towards animation can see that animated shows can be very interesting and mature and not just dumb kid shit.\n\n**Still Up** - surprised for an apple TV show I haven't seen anyone bring this up. I almost skipped it because the IMDb rating seemed mid but I'm pretty surprised cuz I thought it was really funny and easy to watch. I mean it's not like a groundbreaking masterpiece or anything, but I really enjoyed it. If you like chill shows about relationships/friendships/romance then give it a shot. It definitely left me craving another easy comedy with maybe some romance, hopefully there will be a season 2.",

It\u2019s quite a tragic yet beautiful story about a lone wolf character with wonderful homage to Edo period Japan. The show is action packed yet also filled with quiet, serene moments. The animation is cinematically stunning with a harrowing soundtrack. You can feel the love and care the writers and animators put into every detail. \n\nI\u2019ve read quite few comparisons between those two animations in regards to quality of the plot and caliber of animation.

Imagine my surprise when I see a \"baby\" Ralph Cifaretto in court!) alums in their early 80s forms is a hoot. \n\nThis show however is...odd. It's very, VERY 80s. It's like a weird blend of slapstick humor...about very serious issues like AIDS, transgender identities, rape, domestic violence, immigration, etc. One case or arc will be deadly serious like After School Special and the other will be like a trans women punching the sour head partner so hard he falls over his chair backwards and then a cartoon \"wuh?!?\" sound plays while he theatrically holds his head and rolls his eyes. It's like a proto-Ally McBeal in that way where it blends serious character work with absurd, low-brow humor. \n\nIt's also odd in that it's very clearly progressive for its era and trying hard but WOOF. The main character won't take no for an answer from a woman and this is framed as normal, romantic, and even admirable. Soaring sexxxy saxophone plays while he harasses and stalks her. Yeesh. \n\nHowever, I am really liking it? The show has a way of making you care about the main people and root for them and it handles complex and gray area cases with humanity and humor. I recommend it, but you have to be in the mood for dated 80s stuff and very low-quality film.",

Just ask IMDB where it holds the record for having the largest quantity of 9.8 rated episodes out of any TV show (live-action included). The characters are iconic, the monsters are terrifying, the suspense/cliff hangers have you at the edge of your seat and this show features some of the greatest plot twists in all of fiction! I showed this show to my unsuspecting mom (who never watched anime) and his was hooked (although horrified). A show that offput her on first sight made her cry in the finale! Please give this masterpiece a chance (watch in Japanese with subtitles for best experience because the English voice actors are kinda horrible). Also I gotta shout out the new hit Netflix show \"Blue Eye Samurai\" (action/adventure)... this adult animated series has some of the most beautiful animation and awesome bloody sword fights I've ever seen. Both are super bingeable and have impactful first episodes that suck you into the world. Hope this helps, sorry for such a long paragraph",

Why the fuck did we need to know the hacker girl used to date the other guy and they had a falling out? Complete waste of time, added nothing to the story at all. And I almost forgot - no one speaks to each other in a remotely realistic way. One character finds a ship he previously served on and never actually says so. They board the ship and explore for awhile until he finds his belongings and another character pans down to his name on the trunk and says \"Oh, you served on the ship.\" What the fuck?

It's even inspired me to rewatch **Spooks** from the start now, as I want to wait for series 3 to finish so I can binge that to my heart's content then.\n\nThere's something very different about British spy stuff to the Americans. There's a dryness, a self-deprecating element, and a very British pathos that you'll never get with the brash self-confidence of the CIA.

I rewatched it twice back to back because I was so confused thinking that I missed something the first time, but it was just kinda bad. Hopefully the next one will be back on track!\n\nEDIT: (And just as a point of comparison I loved the alien stuff in season 2! Perfect because it was sparsely included, just a dash here, and a dash there, and kind of a neat metaphor for the rapidly changing times... the sudden rise of corporate capitalism represented by the KC mafia. Bizarre symbols that nobody can make sense of... Emergence of the simulacra and end of the old moral paradigms... recall that the whole series of events started when Rye tries to get a judge to help him with an incoherent typewriter-selling scam and then gets angry and violates an absolute rule by killing her. And Dodd's response to the accusation of their clan's involvement: \"Now that don't make no sense. Why would *we* kill a judge, we *own* all the judges?\" ...the alien metaphor wasn't perfectly delivered but I got what they were going for and dug it.)",

Something else that irks me a bit I've seen a lot in most shows where the main male characters never quiet closes their mouths to get that smoldering look... hahaha... I've seen too much TV! \n\nI may switch gears to hate watch The Monarch if there's a new ep. Also hoping to continue watching Six Feet Under if my kid goes to bed early.
