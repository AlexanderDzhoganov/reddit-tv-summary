Don\u2019t know how that bear got there or what that big creature is or how it\u2019s tearing the trees down. Got a great cast here, don\u2019t know many of the actors but I love their interactions with each other. Makes me feel like I\u2019m really watching a bunch of strangers stranded on an island. The drama feels so real and engaging.",

            "body": "I've been getting into Twin Peaks for the past month or so. Finished the final episode the other day. I'm pretty sure that while watching this show, I felt every single emotion that you can possibly feel as a human being in the most intense way. It's bizarre, bone chilling, horrific and dark, yet it's so heartwarming, joyful and life affirming at the same time. Tonally it's all over the place but it worked really well most of the time.\n\n\nThe show is much more melodramatic than I expected. But also much more comedic. It's genuinely laugh out loud funny. I thought the tone of the show would be more consistently cerebral, but it's much more campy and quirky than I expected.\n\n\nSeason 1 was intriguing, weird and funny. The sense of mystery and that feeling of \"something's off here\" was conveyed really well. The melodrama was there but it was tolerable thanks to the interesting variety of characters and the catchy score.\n\n\nSeason 2 tho, the melodrama went into full overdrive. So many dumb plotlines that were just mind numbingly boring and stupid to the point where I almost gave up on the show. The fake chinese man twist. James going on his side quest of hooking up with a sad lonely wife. And whatever the hell the Nadine plotline was all about. But I was invested enough in the characters and in the mystery of Windom Earle and the Black Lodge to keep watching. Thankfully the last couple of episodes turned it around and they finally embraced the weird and uniquely strange elements of the show. I was completely glued to the screen at that point. \n\n\nWindom Earle as a villain was scary at first but ultimately it wasn't very clear what exactly he wanted. Was it revenge or was he after the power of the Black Lodge? Or was he just a crazy psychopath? I thought the moment his character started to get more and more screentime, the less scary he got. But maybe that was a good thing because that in turn made the Black Lodge scarier and more threatening at the same time.\n\n\nThe prequel movie was good but I made the mistake of going into it expecting a sequel since S2 ended on a cliffhanger. So it didn't have a big effect on me sadly. I appreciated the filmmaking but on an emotional level I was left more disappointed than anything else.\n\n\nS3 was an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I feel like this is where the show fully came to its own. The tone was much more balanced between melodrama, comedy, horror and mystery. I loved that the strange and weird scenes were given more time and that they were visually much more fleshed out. The ending was just perfect imo. Didn't give us all the answers but just enough to make up our own conclusions. Loved that.\n\n\nAll around Twin Peaks is a pretty great show. People weren't kidding, when they said how weird and bizarre it is. It lived up to the hype.",

Hell, I wasn't even aware the second half was back until after a couple of episodes were released. The one positive I can bring from the break was that it made me frustrated enough to go and read all the comics. But I didn't buy them thru Amazon. You did this to yourself, Bezos! \n\nComplaints about how the series is managed aside, I did enjoy this season. Having just recently read the storylines, I enjoy the shows pacing much more. Plus all the incredibly talented voice actors and animators really did justice bringing the pages to life. I am super excited about s3 and thrilled to learn that s3 is already in production and aim to do annual releases instead of having year plus gaps between seasons. \n\n**Masters of Air** - Been on and off watching this recently and while the quality is there, I am just not fully feeling it. The shows best parts are obviously while flying but I don't particularly care for the characters outside of one or two of them. I am about six episodes in so I am hoping the remainder of the series picks up. That said, the episode about >!the lone survivor bomber!< is probably where the series peaks and was incredible.",

Clarkson\u2019s Gray was a fun character with a bit of edge about her but pretty much everything else in the show fell a bit flat. \n\n**The Completely Made Up Adventures of Dick Turpin** - Apple\u2019s new British comedy was a bit of a mixed bag. When the comedy worked it was hilarious and when it did not it was a bit forgettable. I\u2019d watch more though! \n\n**Renegade Nell** - Sally Wainwright\u2019s new Disney show was a solid offering. I was unsure about it while watching the early episodes but it won me over as the series progressed and I ended up enjoying it. I think I\u2019d have enjoyed it more if was just a straight historical. Billy Blank was honestly one of the worst magical companions I\u2019ve come across yet! \n\n**Ripley** - I do not foresee this show doing high viewership on Netflix. A real deep arthouse take on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Talented Mr Ripley. Beautiful cinematography and a show with a strong creative voice but definitely too artsy to appeal to a mainstream audience. Easy to see why Showtime ditched it after producing it. The first episode was a bit dull but from the second one onwards I  found this thriller quite compelling despite the slow pacing. Andrew Scott feels like he is lacking a bit of pure charisma to play Tom Ripley in the early episodes but he really shone as the series progressed and he got to display just how twisted Tom was as a character. I thought Johnny Flynn was excellent as well. My early feeling was that both guys were 20 years too old for the characters but they won me over and in the end I thought this was a decent Ripley adaptation. Slow paced and slow starting but once it got going it was compelling with an edge of menace and tension despite the sedate pacing. \n\nNext up I\u2019m probably looking at **Invincible**.",

We are on Season 8 and this is where you can see them start winding up.  The older kids are in college and you can see them setting their weird little lives on track.  You can see the parents' growth as a couple and as parents.  In one particular episode, Mike, the taciturn father makes some uncharacteristically personal disclosures to his daughter about the life and death of his mother.  Eight seasons we've been with the Hecks and Mike has never shared any really personal information about her other than she died when he was a teenager.  Not only does Mike share how she died but he shares some lovely personal little memories of her that gave me a little tear for a young man who suffered missing his mother and had no one to share that with.  \n\nThese are people who have driven the same battered car for 8 years.  They've glued partially stripped wallpaper back to the wall.  Mike has had the same job.  Axel has been lounging around in the same set of boxers he wore in the first season.  This show is based on Midwestern small town people.  Not big changers.  But they do grow and The Middle, while not glamorous or flashy or even as clever as some other sitcoms has a deep heart and it's so worth watching that heart love and break and heal over the course of 9 seasons.   \n\nAlso watched 3 Body Problem. I don't get it.  I don't understand it but I loved it. \n\nAnd I watched HBOs The Truth vs. Alex Jones.  Were you aware that Alex Jones is a rank piece of crap leading a delusional army of supplement chugging morons?  I think everyone knows this, so in that sense this documentary does not turn any new leaves. This documentary does not showcase the Sandy Hook shooting itself but it does recount, briefly, the events of that day.  This documentary is supposed to be about the suits for damages the Sandy Hook parents won against Jones and the penalty phase trials - these trials only determined the amount of damages that would be appropriate as Jones lost these cases by default by failing to produce discovery.  Interesting, but I don't think it went deep enough into what a shyster Jones is.  It touches on Jones' 30 years of schtick, and the methods Jones perfected to propagate fake news and baseless conspiracy theories into a multi-million-dollar circus that culminated with the most cruel Sandy Hook Hoax conspiracy theory.  This left me honestly disgusted and part of my faith in humanity died after watching this.  Good documentary but wasn't a deep enough dive into the worst version of PT Barnum online today.",

I have no insider news but I am predicting he is actually an alien...LOL...that would be a really funny and crazy twist.\n\nWatched the Scoop (Netflix movie) since I finished every good show available and Gillian Anderson and Rufus Sewell both very good. \n\nI have tried one episode of Mary and George, one episode of Palm Royale and 2 episodes of Renegade Neil and none of them are close to 3 body problem or shogun so I am not sure if I want to continue. Might finish Renegade just because I like the cast.",

Still a good follow up to TCW, but if you're not into Star Wars or animated stuff, it's probably not your bag.\n\nFallout - A lot of contention on this one between a lot of the game's fanbase and average viewers because of some lore inconsistencies, but as a diehard Fallout fan I gotta say I can excuse some of those things because A.) the lore inconsistencies are in a pretty murky area, and B.) because the show is just so damn good and honestly captures the themes and feeling of the franchise a lot better than some of the games themselves!\n\nX-Men '97 - Wasn't expecting this one to be as good as it is, but somehow it is. As a child of the new millennium, I had almost no understanding of the X-Men beyond Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. This show makes me understand why people love the X-Men as much as they do, because it fucking slaps.\n\nInvincible - I binged the entire comic series start to finish way before the show came out, and I have to say that I am slightly concerned about this show and how it's produced; the animation is really not anything to write home about, and while I'd say the performances are good, *my issue is that a lot of the time the animation's lackluster quality stifles my empathy with the characters*. Like the Season 1 finale where they went all out on the facial expressions for Omni-Man come to mind as a good example of performance + animation selling it, but in Season 2 there's just nothing like that.",

As a show, it's watchable enough to see once, if you're bored and interested in politics.\n\nWatching **Curb Your Enthusiasm** because the show has some great clips online. Going to give it a season and a half to let the humour grow on me.\n\nStarted the new season of **Star Trek: Discovery**. It's been a minute since I finished a 100% binge watch of all the Star Trek series, so I can't tell if I'm just worn out on Trek or if the serialized , action heavy nature of Discovery is what's grinding on me a bit. Still going to close out the series, but glad we're in the final stretch. I loved the idea of >!The Burn, where the federation had pulled back and allowed space to become a new frontier!<, and it is a bit unfortunate that the show didn't have more time to play with and worldbuild using that idea.",

I liked it more than *Star Wars: Resistance*. The Jedi go around to different planets and have adventures that feel like Star Wars. I wish the show was a bit more serialized and my biggest issue is that there is never any stakes. During any combat it was clear even insignificant characters could not get hit or die so there was never any stakes. Battles would always end with a bad guy escaping to battle another day. And the main characters kept reinforcing that there is \"good in everyone\" and keeps giving the villains more and more chances even though they repeatedly steal and attempt murder. Anyway, my issues I think are more to do with the target demographic than anything else. Having a serialized show or killing off characters is not doable on a show aimed this young. So basically not bad but I guess it was a show aimed older?\n\n**Danny Phantom - Season 2 (2005-2006)**\n\nSeason 2 was a little weaker than season 1 but still a great show. 2 parters in particular were enjoyable. Just hoping for some more meaningful progression. >!Danny finally finds out that Jazz knows his secret!< but I was hoping for more than that like >!Danny's parents finding out or Danny finally getting together with Sam.!< Hopefully season 3 will do these things.",

No sign if this season will also end up on NatGeo/Disney+ (S3-S5 never did). \n\nAnd ***Monsters at Work S2*** (Disney Channel) has started its linear run before it's going to drop on Disney+ at the end of the run (May 5th). [First ep is up on youtube, tho.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63V0JspgvrE)",

While [Season 2 of *Monsters at Work*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMmZS8Z8eM) started up on Disney Channel (will drop on Disney+ when it's done airing).\n\nPrior to that, Amazon Prime dropped [*Hazbin Hotel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSWVCwy88g). Lot more TV-MA-ish and more singing than I was anticipating, but I didn't watch the pilot on Youtube. :)\n\nNetflix's [*Pokemon Concierge*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zmhHLVrq0) is not at all a typical Pokemon show, being stop-motion and more made for women in their '30s as the main character is getting away from her life by becoming a concierge at a island vacation retreat for pokemon. Think *Rilakkuma & Kaoru*, not so much having to catch them all and battle.\n\nNot that new, but new to Netflix, [*Star Trek: Prodigy* S1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxMRhpW_ny8) is now up on Netflix, after Paramount+/Nickelodeon dumped it, and they will be getting the [unaired S2](https://www.startrek.com/videos/star-trek-prodigy-season-2-first-look). The showrunners on this, Dan and Kevin Hageman have the bulk of the story writing credits on [*Trollhunters*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2oNgZlbSKI) and they pulled over two other *Trollhunters* writers with them: Chad Quandt and Aaron Waltke.\n\nAnother *Trollhunters* alum, A.C. Bradley is currently head writer on Disney+'s [*What If...?* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiEVqZ2Bc_c) dropped back in December. They dipped into Neil Gaiman's *1602* universe, btw.\n\nAlso back in December, few people noticed but Netflix's [*Hilda* had its third and final season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqGwCl63GE).\n\nNovember, it was [*Scott Pilgrim Takes Off*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLvRvqByxUI) and [*Blue Eye Samurai*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1yQn17lbE) on Netflix.\n\nOctober, [*Spy x Family* S2](https://youtu.be/QbplUALoyyU) dropped on Hulu.",

We can see how ridiculous his behaviour is because we are familiar with the underpinning custom, whereas Japanese custom (as the 'other') seems mysterious and magical, but they are really just the same. That is to say, we have context to see the silliness in one but not the other, so Blackthorne's behaviour allows us to see how silly they both are [from a certain perspective].

I feel mixed about the 2nd season, I don\u2019t think it was as compelling as the 1st season. \n\nAlso binged: **Crime Scene Berlin: Nightlife Killer**, a 3 part true-crime doc on Netflix about a serial killer in Berlin who poisoned 4 men he had met in bars. This was an ok documentary, it is good if your looking for a short binge with the episodes only around 30 minutes. \n\nAlso watched: **The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem**, a doc-movie on Netflix about the early beginnings of 4chan to present day, time-lining various points in it\u2019s history from it\u2019s early days of sharing memes, to it\u2019s role in the spread of disinformation and the January 6th attack on the Capitol. I\u2019d recommend watching if you know nothing about 4chan, which I did not know prior to watching. \n\nStill yet to watch: \n* **Ripley (mini).**\n* **X-Men \u201897 s1.**",

Up to episode 7 I thought this was a masterpiece, really, and so I was selling it to anyone around me. Then along came episode 8 with a scene that completely destroys the credibility of the characters, the writing, everything. My guess is this particular scene is taken directly from the book, and it was a must. Still, they could have tried to make it a little bit better, a little bit less cringy or ridiculous. Anyway, my suspension of disbelief couldn't take it, sadly. Apart from that, this has been just a treat. The set design and dressing, the actors, the locations, the photography, the sound design, those little sparks of humor amongst the darkness of the tale. I hope they continue the show.\n\nLast episode of **Shogun** was fun. Gee man. These people are a bit too much. They fart in public: Well, I guess I'm doing seppuku now.

I recognize the show's quality, but I'm also not interested in a show that is pretty literally just a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\n**Tokyo Vice** - I slowly fell behind, and have 3 or 4 episodes to go in season 2. I realized I didn't care enough about anybody to bother with getting caught up to see the end.\n\n**Ripley** - I watched through episode 3.
