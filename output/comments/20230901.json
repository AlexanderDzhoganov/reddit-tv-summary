Finished second episode so far.\n\n**Foundation** is now one of my top 5 favorite scifi/fantasy shows. Every episode turns out better and more interesting. I'm even enjoying the gall/hari scenes. Jarid Harris and Lee Pace (and rest of Cleons casts) are the nuts and bolts holding the scenes together in place. Without them, the show would've gone to a mediocre adaption had it not been for amazing writers and creative team. Amazing, dare I say, I enjoyed it more than **Andor** and it was a great show in its own league.\n\nAbout to resume the third season of **The Great**, too bad they canceled the show but from what I'm aware of. The third season concludes well enough to stand as a series' finale. So that's a plus, anyways I'll find out once I'm done watching.\n\nAbout to start the second season of **Wheel of Time**, the previous season was quiet controversial amongst the book readers but I hadn't read the books so my opinion is rather not too puritan. However, it didn't scratch that itch GoT (the good parts) have left behind.\n\nWill resume the second season of **Flowers** after I'm done with One Piece.\n\nI miss **Master of None**, the two seasons were peak quality. I'm gonna pretend the spinoff didn't happen. It was a watchable show by its own, but not the same without the core cast and their side hustles, too serious for a dramedy genre.\n\nNo show came close to **Station Eleven**. I can't articulate it well enough but that show just hit me with feels.\n\nEdit: grammar fixes.",

Bad acting, pouting adolescents, moaning adults and just one or two characters that don't grate on my nerves.

Probably more if you're into the anime and pick up on details I didn't.\n\n**Interview with a Vampire** \\- This was really good and varied from the movie enough to make it interesting.  I really dug the storyline and I like that it had a lot more details than the movie.  I remember in High School and College getting into the books and loving Vampire Lestat.  I'm probably going to go read it again as I've not read it in about 26 years.\n\n**Telemarketers** \\- This documentary is fucking nuts.

It's one of the funniest shows ever made. The 4 main vampires are all roles of a lifetime for each actor. Especially Berry.\n\n**This Fool:** Binged this last week and was shockingly caught off guard. It started off a little rough but once I got hooked, every episode was hilarious.\n\n**Twisted Metal:** WHOA. Did not expect this show to be good at all. It was a ton of fun. Stephanie Beatriz was terrific.\n\n**Warrior:** The absolute best action show ever made, solidified by that final showdown in the season finale. I've watched it multiple times already.\n\n**Eastbound and Down:** Took me way too long to watch this. All of Danny McBride's tv shows have the same tone and I love that. All three on HBO will make you laugh out loud consistently.\n\n**The Other Two:** Very sad this show is over but it ended on a high note. The finale was thoughtfully put together and gave us some closure with both Cary and Brooke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Watching Weekly***\n\n**Heels:** I think this is easily the most underrated show currently airing. I never see people discussing it, which is unfortunate. The show has top level acting with a heavy plot that delivers every week.\n\n**Winning Time:** Talk about underrated, I guess this is right there with Heels, but it shouldn't be. The first season was heavily promoted but apparently it's likely to be canceled due to low viewership for this season. You don't even need to know or follow basketball to like this show. Please watch it.\n\n**The Challenge: USA:** Well, I wasn't that keen on this CBS-ified new Challenge situation. I miss the feel of The Challenge on MTV in the mid 2010s. But I get it, it will never be that way again. I will say, this season has been solid so far. They have the right vets involved enough (Bananas and Wes) to keep my interest. Also digging some of the other players that aren't vets.\n\n**Billions:** This show is the clear example of why Succession stopped at 4 seasons. Nothing wrong with where Billions is as I still am interested and engaged but damn, the show is never hitting that level of the first few seasons again. Glad they are wrapping it up this season though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Shows I'm Binging:***\n\n**One Piece:** Just started it. It's interesting, for sure. We'll see how much I actually like it.\n\n*Shows I'm thinking of giving a shot:*^(Insights or recommendations would be great!)\n\n* Mare of Easttown\n* Invincible\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* The Afterparty\n* Reservation Dogs\n* Killing It\n* Happy Valley\n* Rectify\n* Halt and Catch Fire\n* Homeland\n* Sherlock",

Lost or 24 (the one people will compare it the most I guess, being almosy in real time) level.\n\nSeries overall is not the greatest ever for sure but it's very good and as I said addictive. In a way it would unironically be a perfect show to occupy you during a flight lol.\n\nIn the middle of Foundation S2 (not exactly up to date, I have 2 episodes late I think). It's pretty great already loved S1 and S2 is even better (they improved the non-Empire storylines). Show still looks so good visually too.",

Inaki Godoy is great, I liked him before this and he's just infectiously enthusiastic.\n\nRecently finished HBO's Ballers after it popped up on Netflix.  Definitely not a great show but The Rock and Rob Corddry had good chemistry ... unfortunate that they're like, never on screen at the same time in later seasons.  Presumably that was a result of scheduling conflicts but it really kills the best parts of the show.  John David Washington is consistently excellent in it though.\n\nBallers prompted me to start a rewatch of Entourage ... which has just not aged well at all.  Amazing how much the entertainment world has changed in ~15 years.  I still enjoy some of it as a guilty pleasure and it evolves a bit as it goes, but the early seasons are pretty rough.",

There's something a shade patronizing about how people treat the main subject--she's a traumatized, lower-class, uneducated very young single mother with a troubled past living in a trailer-- and I think this is actually leading them to believe she's more innocent than she is in a weird way.

Jessica Ferguson is great, most of the other acting is a serviceable to a little lackluster but I'll watch S2.

Through two episodes S2 seems to be a big improvement but it's so far off the rails in terms of story people just need to accept that it is almost totally it's own thing set in a WoT-like universe.

The characters, especially Balon Skoll and his apprentice, look incredible and I\u2019m compelled enough by the story that I WANT to like them and know more about them.

Some of the production values also seem improved and it looks/feels less like a CW kind of show.

This is not nearly as well-written, cohesive, and well-woven as *Happy Valley*. I'm no fan of the storytelling structure. Granted, this is an episodical when I prefer the serial format, but even for an episodical the show feels rushed, disjointed, and relies on telling rather than showing a little too often. Things don't have time to unfold organically or breathe. Luckily, the two leads are talented, compelling, grounded actors who draw you in and I'm not going to resist. (Also, it's fun seeing how many actors both shows share.)\r\r  \n\r  \n**Good Omens s2:** it's gorgeous, it's charming, it's whimsical, it's funny. And it's boring. It bores me so much. Yes, yes it has its moments that hook and entertain and move, and Sheen and Tennant are really good and likeable, but on the whole... I don't particularly care for it. And yet I will probably watch s3. It's how it is sometimes\r\r  \n\r  \n*Binging*\r  \n\r  \n**Scott & Bailey s2:** Lesley Sharp has the loveliest voice. So smooth and calm. Anyway, I'm enjoying this season. While still rushed it does feel a little more streamlined. Love the little things the actors do in the background to make it more real. It doesn't always work, granted (sometimes it's too distracting), but most of the time it really adds to the experience \n\n\r*Weekly*\r  \n\r  \n**It's Always Sunny s16:** nice seeing the whole gang being the gang.

Let's hope episode 4 improves this.\n* **Winning Time:** It's a shame this is such a niche show, as it's a great ensemble drama.  Some of the worst tendencies of season 1 have been dialed back in season 2, and the cast is incredibly watchable.  I'd really like to see this show get at least one more season to appropriately tell its story.\n* **What We Do In The Shadows:** This show is so easy to watch, every episode is hilarious.\n* **Reservation Dogs:** Another easy watch.  I'll miss this show when it's gone.  May be easier to track if it's binged as opposed to watching weekly.\n* **Physical:** I feel like this show has dropped in quality a little bit.  There's only a handful of episodes left, so I'll stick it out, but it's been a bit of an up-and-down season thus far.\n\n*Finished*\n\n* **Justified City Primeval:** This was fine.  While I love Timothy Olyphant I had some issues with the pacing and general predictable storylines, particularly in the midway point of the season.  It was still enjoyable, and I chuckled a bit at the ending, which reminded me of the ending to . . .\n* **Cobra Kai:**  I'm glad that this show is ending in Season 6, because it seems to have run out of things to say.  Originally a reframing of Johnny Lawrence as a misunderstood bad guy, the series has progressively grown more and more cartoonish.  I do like that, in the Cobra Kai universe, there's seemingly a dojo on every street corner.\n* **My Adventures with Superman:** The last episode was one of the strongest of the series and did exactly what a season finale should - answer the questions of the season while revealing more for the future.  One of the strongest takes on Superman in any media since the original Animated Series.\n\n*On Deck* \n\nFor once I don't have a show sitting in my queue just waiting to be watched.  We will likely pick something from our backlog of shows to catch up on.\n\n*Bonus Cartoon Corner*\n\n* **Vinland Saga:** I'm still watching this one, although I'll likely finish it later this week, as I'm midway through season 2.",

I put off the last two episodes because I had heard the penultimate one was a musical. I managed to get through it with a lot of fast forwarding though. I've enjoyed the season other than that episode though.\n\nUltimately seems like it's been kind of a slow year.

The back drop does involve a US covert operative trying to get black budget money into Iran to influence their election but this is a dark comedy along the lines of Barry but perhaps more grounded and comedy that it takes episodes to set up a punch line for.

I kept hearing how this was like Entourage, but Entourage was a bloated mediocre drama, Sex and the City is mostly a comedy with the more serious relationships acting as the dramatic threads to carry between serialized content. \n\nThe show is decent and very flawed, but I'm having a good time. It's at its best being funny and exploring Samantha, Miranda, or Charlotte. Really anyone besides Carrie, which is both a reflection on the dramatic writing and the type of person she represents. The show is through Carrie's narrative, and every episode concludes with some sort of epiphany or philosophical connection to what happened to her in the episode, but they almost never make sense, which makes her come off as very dumb. She's also the worst out of the group, easily; Samantha's problems come from her being promiscuous but being promiscuous isn't inherently bad, Miranda suffers from being cynical and successful but she's usually got a point with her cynism and is unfairly treated for having a good job and apartment, Charlotte wants a traditional relationship and doesn't like when her friends push boundaries and none of those things are wrong. \n\nCarrie is a delusional narcist who puts herself in bad relationships and lashes out at the people around her, despite being a terribly unaware person and very judgemental of people's lifestyles the show is through her narrative as a sex columnist. She is described in nearly every episode as a good or inspirational writer by someone , and is New York City famous, her success being constantly reiterated makes the sexually regressive narratives exceptionally ironic. For a \"progressive\" show about four successful women reclaiming what it means to be sex-positive, the show feels very regressive in its writing.\n\nIt might seem like it has more negatives than positives but 3/4 characters are great, It's mostly a comedy and it's got some very funny moments. So far, 7/10",

Poor writing, clich\u00e9d lines of dialogue and silly acting from thin characters. Only one that can hold a scene is Ray Stevenson, and his character is the only one having a personality.\n\nSure, the production design is crisp and the effects are good, but come on, it's 2023, this is to be expected from a 100 million dollar+ Disney production. If you're not a die hard fan, will watch anything Star Wars, then I don't think you'll find much new here. Morgan Elsbeth? Silly. The actress can't act for nothing, chewing the scenery, and not in an - Ian McDiarmid Palpatine - kind of way, just a terrible head-shaking kind of way. Sabine and the other blonde evil padawan are just awfully boring to watch. I suppose I'm in the minority here, but this is not something I will continue watching after 4 episodes.

I found that this season dragged a little in all fronts. I don't even know if I'll go on and watch the final one. Of course the Kristen Wiig episode was a clear highlight, but not enough for me to engage with the rest of the storylines.  Maybe it's just not for me.",

Fairly disappointing given the source material (to put things mildly), though the tech-priests (and a few other characters) are great. Lee Pace et al remain good, obviously, but it's difficult to maintain a long running, serious sci-fi show on that alone without becoming repetitive and (eventually) running out of ideas / variations on the same thing. Gale / Salvor had an interesting looking plot line before they ran that straight into the ground. Meanwhile, the writers continue *to simply not understand what asimov's foundation was actually about*, which... maybe makes sense when you realize that this show is run by a guy who wrote (very successful) DC comic book films.\n\nMight watch **Invasion S2** at some point just to hatewatch (a la S1) and see what a clusterf--- S2 is.",
