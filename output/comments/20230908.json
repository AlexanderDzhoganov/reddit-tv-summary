The plot is so incredibly well written that by the end of the final season it manages to tie off all loose ends in a manner that makes sense. The acting, the background score and the cinematography are all top tier. I loved the chemistry between the actors who played Jonas and Martha a lot, they had such amazing chemistry. The show managed to confuse me yet kept me interested and engaged for the most part of the show which is quite a mean feat imo. The only negative aspect or a gripe that I had with this show was the pacing in the first few episodes of the third season, which felt incredibly slow and tedious to watch however it improved later on which brings it down to a 9/10 imo.",

Glad I finally gave it a chance and now I see why it\u2019s always mentioned here. It\u2019s very hilarious. For those who are in the \u201cdark\u201d like I was, it\u2019s a mockumentary style comedy about vampires. Raunchy humor; very funny. \n\n4 Blocks - thank you to the redditor that mentioned this several months ago. I made a note to check it out next time I had HBO, and I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s a German drama about a Lebanese crime family in Berlin. \n\nNathan For You - would only catch an episode here and there when it originally aired and always thought it was hilarious. Decided to go back & watch it in its entirety. Awkward cringe comedy is my favorite type so I love this show. (Will watch The Rehearsal next but wanted to get through all the episodes of NFY first).\n\nHow To with John Wilson - more awkward comedy but this one is more subtle and \u201cartsy\u201d(?) than NFY. I wasn\u2019t sure about it while watching the first episode but then it clicked for me right at the end of the first episode and I am now all in for this journey!\n\nWho\u2019s Line is it Anyway (Drew Carey version) - my current background show while doing chores & to watch with my kid who is on his school\u2019s varsity improv team. \n\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent - I\u2019m not ashamed to admit I\u2019m always entertained by this show. I don\u2019t care for the singing competition shows but this one I like. It\u2019s the show we watch when it\u2019s been a long day and we don\u2019t have any brain power.",

            "body": "**Made in Heaven** on Prime. I plan on making a stand alone post for this, because this show is *amazing* and I suspect it's very overlooked due to the subtitles and setting. \n\nIt's set in Delhi, India and the dialogue is a mix of local dialects and English. It's about two friends operating a wedding planning business but it's SO much more. It's about classism, sexism, modernization, culture, romance, friendship, and the struggle to decriminalize homosexuality in India. Season 1 was filmed in 2018 and later that year, the laws changed which makes for an incredibly satisfying ending chyron screen. \n\nThe show is *so good*. I can't recommend it enough. It shares some DNA with shows like The L Word (peek inside an insular community, soapy drama), Sex and the City (lives and loves of big-city singles, gorgeous fashion and sets), Gossip Girl (lives of the ultra-rich--they have problems too!) and various CW shows. I realized with a jolt about episode 8 that there had been *0* white people featured up until then and that felt both normal/natural and totally revolutionary. \n\nIt has a few minor flaws--the largest of which is that while the show critiques arranged or coerced marriages, it also leans on an old trope of a reluctant bride or a lower-class woman marrying into a 'Terrible Rich People' family and struggling and acting out. Just once I'd like to see a raggedy social climber marry into the family and bring it off marvelously. \n\nI'm also a bit more interested in brides *willing* to marry for political alliances (although the show does feature one such bride) rather than the downtrodden hopeless romantic defying her father. \n\nThe Karan plot felt a tad bit dragged out for my taste but then I'm not a gay Indian man living in India, and I suspect that for that audience, this was a wonderful breath of fresh air and much needed representation. \n\nHonestly I could go on and on about this show but *please* watch it. Can't wait to dive into Season 2.\n\n**Mask Girl** on Netflix. \n\nAnother TV show with English dubbing/subtitles, this time the show is almost entirely in Korean originally. An interesting (if totally unbelievable) premise with some intriguing characters. My biggest complaint with Korean shows is how bouncy and in your face and OTT the acting and storylines are. Dial it back just a touch! She doesn't need to stab him 17 times in a row, ya know?",

This is peak trash TV ... but somehow entertaining-ish.\n\n**Current binges**:\n\n* One Piece.  I liked it.  I wasn't blown away or anything, and I have no desire to get into the source material, but it was light and fun with surprising emotional depth.  I loved Inaki Godoy in The Imperfects and he's great in this.  Sanji was another standout for me, as was Zeff.  Solid 7.5/10 show and I hope it continues.\n* Entourage.  Finished my complete rewatch this week, including the movie.  This show has *not* aged well in its treatment of women and its sexist/homophobic/ableist language (although it gets better in later seasons).  I still like it, though.  Johnny Drama is a great character, and I have a permanent crush on Dana Gordon.\n* Billions.  I've never watched this show before and started it up the other night.

I\u2019d say it was better than the 1st season as the characters were much more likeable. Also I felt like the 1st season got too fixated on the themed episodes that they forgot to write comedy, but this season definitely got the balance right. Only thing that I didn\u2019t like was Danner\u2019s episode it just felt like an unnecessary detour from the main plot. If it does get renewed I would watch another season but if it ended with the 2nd season I wouldn\u2019t mind.\n\nAlso watched: **Scout\u2019s Honor: The Secret Files of the Boy Scouts of America**, a doc-movie on Netflix about the Boy Scouts of America covering up an epidemic of sexual abuse in their troops. I\u2019d recommend this doc though it is a hard watch.\n\nAlso watched: **The Rosa Peral Tapes** on Netflix a Spanish doc-movie on Netflix about Rosa Peral a mother and police office who was convicted jointly with her lover of murdering her partner who was also a police officer. The doc didn\u2019t seem that well done. Also this is the companion doc to the dramatised series called Burning Body which was released on the same day.\n\nYet to watch: \n\n* **My Adventures With Superman s1,** \n* **Dear Child (mini)**\n* **Never Let Him Go (mini).**",

Funny and heartwarming all the way to the end.\n\n- I started watching Kung Fu Panda - Legends of Awesomeness, because I watched the movies and needed more (did the same with How To Train Your Dragon and its shows, Riders of Berk, Defenders of Berk and Race to the Edge a few months ago, HIGHLY recommend those). Legends of Awesomeness actually surprised me. It''s obviously very lighthearted, there are no real character arcs or progression (understandable, because it's for kids) and the animation can look pretty bland and janky. However, the fight scenes look surprisingly good, the character interactions are pretty great, and the humor is genuinely great. It's very much not canon to the movies, but if you love KFP and want more, it's worth a watch.\n\n- Still need to watch the new Daryl Dixon show, really excited for it.",

It's unclear to me what direction the show wants to go in but it's interesting enough I keep watching. It's not in my top shows on Apple Plus but if you want something fun it's a decent watch. \n\nChangeling. I enjoyed this one so far. I was not familiar with the source material but I'm glad I stuck with it. End of episode 3 has me pretty interested to see where the show goes. \n\nSlow Horses. I finished season 1. I'm going to start season 2 soon. For some reason it took me 3 tries to get through the first episodes but I'm glad I kept going. \n\nUp next for me Ted Lasso season 3 and Hijack.",

This would include Black Bird (perhaps the best show I've seen in the last year) and the absolutely crazy Dr. Brain.  I don't think I've seen anyone mention this show before and I wasn't even sure what it was about when I first started watching.  It revolves around a doctor who has invented a device that allows two brains to sync together and transfer the memories of one to the other which the doctor then uses to investigate some strange happenings in his personal life.  This is played very straight as a mystery drama right up until the point that the doctor decides to do the brain sync with his cat to see what it saw.  He does in fact acquire the cat's strange memories but also acquires cat \"powers\"  which the show plays off as completely normal.  This is all wonderfully batshit insane.  Can't wait for S2.",

It's filling the sci-fi hole that The Expanse left, despite being very different shows (Jared Harris aside).\n\nSeason one is a bit of a slog but it is the definition of slow burn. It has a lot of world building to do in that first season and some actors don't really settle into their characters until season two. \n\nSeason two has been riveting week to week. the showrunner(s) know the strengths and weaknesses of the first season and are very much playing to their strengths now. I could watch Lee Pace read the phone book as Cleon.\n\n***One Piece*** has been quite enjoyable. I'm familiar with the manga/anime (watched some and read a bit more). It's well made but it lacks that \\*magic\\* the original has. The narrative changes work for live action and they've made characters who I found unlikeable to have more nuance and dimension to them. God knows when we will get another season (assuming it gets renewed)\n\n***What we do in the Shadows*** \\- Less laughs per episode this year than seasons previous. I enjoy it but I think it might of run it's course. I hated the way the season ended with a handwaving of sorts after a build up of years for certain character.\n\n***How to with John Wilson*** \\- It's one of those shows I could watch an episode a week for the rest of my days. So clever and interesting. The joke is as much on John as it is the people he talks to. The humour may not be everyone's taste but it's the only show that makes me laugh and possibly cry in single episode. That episode about vacuum cleaners... That's something special.",

It was overall a 6.5/10, it had its moments of good action but some of the side plots were unneeded. I can totally see why some people say it would\u2019ve been better as a movie but honestly I\u2019m not sure if a lot would watch it as a movie or get as much attention. I\u2019m interested to see where season 2 goes. I\u2019d be very open to them starting with a new lioness\n\nJustified city of primeval: finished season 1. Last fifteen minutes was a banger. I know some people didn\u2019t like some of the supporting cast throughout the season but I do think this season still was needed to show a different side of Raylan given all the years and it really helps build up the finale. No spoilers.  I\u2019ll be interested to see how many episodes season 2 will be and when that\u2019ll be released given the strikes and actors availability. \n\nTop boy: Mediocre season with glimpses of its previous seasons\u2019 success. Decent series finale that was true to the two main characters. Would be an injustice any other way. I can see why some people felt some immigration stuff felt forced or overly political but the show always been that way in the background. It always been even from the original series about immigrants and commoner struggles in London\u2026 \n\nAshoka: Starting to pick up steam.

We see what happens to this innocent girl when she falls under the manipulation of the lead bully and how it impacts her. In the present, we see the young woman struggle to move on in many ways many years after the events. It all starts with her seeing the successful grown woman who suffered the worst of the bullying.

They both have that particular comic-book adapation style that involves quite a bit of violence surrounded by a show that is otherwise adolescent in its sensibilities. They also have initial antagonists that are hyper-stylized violent clowns(!). Perhaps One Piece might become like **Full Metal Alchemist** where the world-bulding and plot overcome the otherwise juvenille nature of the characterizations but I'm not sticking around to find out. I also didn't like the actor playing the One Piece lead, something about him was slightly off-putting.\n\nI also bounced off **Waiting** (Apple TV), with its soft-focus camera style, constant scenes discussing the protagonist's emotions and psychological state, and retinue of quirkly side characters it really, really, has the feel of a rom-com. I didn't hate it but at 40 minutes per episode and Jason Segel not being particularly compelling to me I'm getting out on this one, although my wife is continuing with it.\n\nI will probably get around to **Black Mirror**'s (Netfix) latest season next, it's been sitting on my list for a while.",

Maybe the book is better, I won't be reading it. The story is all over the place, the characters aren't even two dimensional and I found myself not caring a bit if they lived or died (maybe apart from the store manager guy, poor man was just trying to run the shop). Long stretches of nothing happening interspersed with shockingly weird moments of sexuality and violence but there really isn't enough going on to justify 500 minutes. The plot is nonsensical enough but I rolled with it in the hope it would develop into something good but it just trundles along meandering all over the place until it hits a dragged out and not very entertaining or fulfilling denouement which is needlessly spread out over 2 episodes. The bad guy was a dipshit, the actor was fine but the character was terribly conceived and not interesting at all. 4/10",

It feels like the story is finally taking shape. Last year, I'd go weeks without watching the latest episode but this year, I have very impatiently waited for each episode to drop.",

I'm on round 3 of For All Mankind rewatching it from beginning to end to dissect each character and scene, sets and Im not into space fantasy, Star Wars (new), Star Trek, or typical sci-fi alien movies, but (FAM) is a fun one I can remain engaged and not ADHD out. THANK YOU UNIVERSE for sending us the writers and actors and directors and every person involved on this production team.  Todd Kessler (Bloodline, Sopranos, 6 Feet Under is behind The New Look (about Christian Dior, Coco Chanel during the 1940s).  Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul), David Fincher (prob my current fav. feature length film director).  When you binge on Bloodline, BB, Better Call Saul, MadMen, HouseofCards, The Bureau (French spy), & The Office (both US /UK), Succession, Silicone Valley, discover hidden gems like Start Up, where do you go from there? You repeat until your eyes cross. No idea how the book series For All Mankind ends or continues..but I hope it continues. FAM is a fun drama/sci-fi series. Ray Bradbury & Kurt Vonnegut (Sirens of Titan) would be so happy and is likely giving FAM their mark of approval & thumbs up from a planet or star in a distant galaxy. BTW I'm not a Trekky or GoT or Harry Potter or new Star Wars Dune fan either but I love me some alternate universes or What If we could rewrite history? ALSO PALM ROYALE!!!",
