While the mystery ultimately takes a backseat, the real charm of the show is learning about this tightknit group of sisters and how this cartoonishly evil brother-in-law totally disrupts their lives. The actor who played the villian did a great job. \n\nI also liked the contrast between the \"bad sisters\" and the pair of brothers trying to investigate the crime. \n\nThe ending felt satisfying, so I was surprised to learn that there will be a second season.

(Not that I know exactly how British police works, but this does look convincing)\r  \n\r  \n**Only Murders s3:** it's a solid three out of five stars kind of show that's been pretty consistent in quality throughout the seasons. It's charming, nice to look at, has some really good acting (and some really bad acting), a fantastic theme song, and even though I never give a crap about who's murdered or why, it's still enjoyable to watch\r  \n\r  \n**The Afterparty s2:** ugh. I do love this concept, so despite not enjoying s1 a whole lot, I still watched this.

The Flanderization jump between season 4 and 5 is huge. \n\npre-ben & chris episodes get brought up for being bad a lot here, but it's really season 1, which is dry and the characters are mostly different (especially Ron who is fully re-written after season 1), but it's still alright. season 2 is amazing and maybe the second-best season, nearly every episode is iconic and funny, and it's probably the only season the characters don't feel like caricatures. S3 is definitely the peak but once the show starts leaving the parks and rec department in 4 the writing starts to rely more heavily on the personalities.\n\nThe reputation really carries the last 3 seasons of the show, there are some amazing episodes scattered in them but it's few and far between. I catch myself skipping a lot of episodes\n\nEDIT: I would still strongly recommend Parks and Rec for any sitcom fans, I don't think I've seen a single sitcom that doesn't have similar issues. Seasons 2-4 are peak sitcom and there are still strong episodes later on that make it worth it.",

Strangely episodes 14-15 are a 2 parter which seem to wrap all of it up then the final three episodes of the season (15-18) feel like an extended epilogue wrapping up any lingering family drama, plot points, and setting up season 4.

It has some very good moments - its most annoying aspect is being so derivative of Frasier #1 - even while it sort of acknowledges that. I would wonder what reactions are from people who never watched Frasier.\n\nThe first half of episode 1 I thought was pretty funny - laughed out loud more than once. It got a bit bogged down with all the complications of the son's personal life. 2nd episode was SO derivative of Frasier and his dad and his dad's chair, although they kind of make that being the point. The one joke I really DID appreciate is the son telling his friends his father was dead - because that had been a point between \"Cheers\" and \"Frasier\" (in Cheers Frasier had told them his father was dead which then had to be 'explained' in \"Frasier\")\n\nWhile I have issues with Kelsey Grammar as a person, I must say I think he does great by the character of Frasier - he is an excellent 'sitcom' actor. I thought everyone else was pretty good - have no  objections to Freddie as I've seen some do. This show DOES have a hell of a lot of secondary characters and wonder how many will make it as the show progresses.\n\nALas I guess this new series will once again have Frasier seeking for 'true love' as in Frasier 1 which I do  not look forward to and guess we'll have episodes of him and Freddie 'double dating' (ugh).\n\nBut at least for me, after 2 episodes, I like it enough to keep watching.

It does get more serious too if it's \"too much comedy\" in the first episodes for people starting.\n\nI loved it but I'm admittedly a Flanagan stan. Ill rank it below Hill House and Midnight Mass ultimately probably, but ngl I see myself re-watching this again soon.\n\nSpoilers: \n>!I have to add that I don't think I've been got by jump scares like this maybe ever. I don't know if I just assumed they weren't going to happen since Flanagan doesn't use them often or what but holy fuck.

I especially liked how they weave corporate interests into the intersections of politics and the military - everyone are sort of a pawns to forces beyond their control with the money people sitting on the sidelines and taking advantage of that to make profits.\n\nI don't think its fair some have accused this show of Islamophobia as the most sympathetic character turns out to be the 'mark' of the operation.\n\nThe one bad thing in the show was the annoying teenage daughter of the character running the operation and her issues. I think they overdid her and all her 'drama'.\n\nBut it was good, a good balance of action and social commentary.",

Then there's a lot of whispering coming from Wilson, which I always imagine it's a bit of a nightmare for the sound designer, the guy with the boom and so on. Also, if he starts whispering then it kind of forces the other actors to whisper too, so they all end up whispering. A whispering feast. Anyway, nice show.",

It was\u2026not as bad as I feared. Definitely a bunch of changes from the book. Which resulted in me liking some characters more and others less in the show vs the book. Biggest loser in this was Nynaeve. I loved book Nynaeve but the TV version seems pretty limp by comparison which is disappointing. Egwene and Lan were the biggest winners. I like the TV versions a lot more than their book counterparts. Moiraine feels like a totally different character but I\u2019ve gotten used to that fairly quickly. \n\nI recall folks saying WoT looked cheap in terms of production but I thought this looked pretty slick and you could see they had thrown cash at the show. \n\nOn the whole I\u2019ll say I enjoyed this one even if it was not particularly faithful to the book at lot of the time.

It's quiet gut-wrenching too, contemplating the treatment of this animal and the treatment of native people. So yeah, tons of brutality. As expected.\n\nI'm on season 4 of my rewatch of **The Wire**. It's never been my favourite season, but of course I'm saying that in the context of this show. The whole thing is a fucking mic-drop. It set the bar so high for anybody willing to make an impact on tv fiction, or just storytelling in general.\n\nThis season might very well be the most heartbreaking of them all, because you are dealing with kids. They are the most vulnerable, and you see how  the grounds from which they are supposed to grow are totally contaminated and perverted, and how easy it is to go astray in those environments.",

No laugh-tracks. They find certain shows too dark and dense as well. At the same time, this person doesn\u2019t want to watch shows that are just escapism like Emily in Paris or Bridgerton. Doesn\u2019t mind sex scenes or vulgar language. We have Max, Apple TV and Netflix but would consider adding other streaming service. For example, I already know that Sharp Objects, Broadchurch, Chernobyl, I May Destroy You, Band of Brothers, and The Last of Us will not work. \n\nWe\u2019ve briefly watched Veep, Community, Barry and Parks and Recreation. Aforementioned family member couldn\u2019t stand any of those shows after one episode and refused to continue (I like to give shows more of a chance, but I\u2019m not going to force this person to watch something they insist they dislike). They also thought The Righteous Gemstones was too violent. \n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve already watched in their entirety or are still watching and enjoyed: S1 of Kevin Can F Himself, Schitt\u2019s Creek, The White Lotus, Arrested Development, Parenthood, The Middle, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Modern Family, The Office, Succession, Gilmore Girls, Little Fires Everywhere, The Undoing and Big Little Lies. Family member has also already watched/watches The Crown, The Morning Show and Mare of Easttown; I have not (yet). \n\nShows we\u2019ve never seen that I suspect may be what we\u2019re looking for: Severance, Bodyguard, The Bear, 1923, Derry Girls, Somebody Somewhere, Fleabag, and the first two seasons of House of Cards.\n\nAny other suggestions?",

In my case, she would say she didn't like a certain sort of show but then there seemed to be exceptions to that. Which, that was alright and made for some pleasant surprises some time. \n\n**The Resort** on Peacock might work. I think you probably have a good pick already with The Bear on Hulu, it is hard not to love a show about food. BTW, if you do like The Bear you may want to check out the movie Chef with Jon Favreau and a small part by Oliver Platt (who is also in The Bear). \n\nOn Netflix you might check out **The Get Down**. It is hard to describe so I'll just go with Netflix's description of \"it follows the rise of hip-hop and disco music through the eyes of a group of teenagers.\" It is made by Baz Luhrman who made Moulin Rouge. Also **The Beef** has some violence and can get dark, but also may be surprisingly SO friendly IMO. It is about a road rage incident that results in two people acting badly but they also turn out to be human beings. \n\nIf you ever want to try some sci-fi AND get another streaming service (maybe just a trial), Paramount's **Star Trek Strange New Worlds** is pretty strong, family friendly, and has less violence than you would think (though there is still some). On Hulu, The Orville is a great watch as well in kind of the same vein. If you feel like getting a free trial to MGM+ (used to be called AMC+) check out **Moonhaven** (or maybe just [buy an episode for $2 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/The-Pilot/dp/B0B5HT717P/ref=sr_1_2?crid=22SNYZ55F1T13&keywords=moonhaven&qid=1697633112&s=instant-video&sprefix=moonhaven%2Cinstant-video%2C82&sr=1-2) to see if you like it). It is only 6 episodes and is about a murder that takes place on the moon, but everyone on the moon is all about that hippy lifestyle and tends to solve their problems with interpretive dance. OK, that is a terrible way to describe but I actually did like it and it was like, a breath of fresh air and had some ideas I don't think I have seen in any other shows. I truly, truly love that show and wish more people would get a chance to see it. \n\nActually, one more that can be purchased on Amazon is **Kings**. There is only one season but it is very good. It was a summer replacement on NBC ~15 years ago that asks the question, what if a modern nation was a full fledged monarchy?\n\nThat's it. Some of these, maybe most of them, probably won't take your SO's interest but maybe there is one or two that work.",

He's doing campy, very self-referential material that's full of winks to the audience. Kim is very well cast and acquits herself very well with limited material. I had some chuckles at her lines and honestly...I'm fed UP with the misogyny around \"Kim is famous for nothing\"/\"I hate the Kardashians\". She has worked her *ass off* with clothing lines, video games, public appearances, her store, perfumes, makeup, the TV show, etc etc. Yes, her original claim to fame was a leaked sex tape. **Get over it** there are tons and tons of people with much less of a toehold in popular culture who cling to relevance and don't get near the hate of the Kardashians. \nMoving on from that, it's tonally very different than other AHS seasons. It's quiet and downbeat, almost like shows that continued to shoot during CoVid. It has an empty and very...Westworld Season 4 feeling so far. \n\nNot a show but **Pearl** movie on Paramount Plus. It was good! Mia Goth gives the performance of a lifetime (if she has to spit out of bit of scenery to do so at times) and it's stylish and has a very distinct point of view. It's a tad...undercooked and has some cliches at times, but there are some outstanding costuming choices--the top hat and dress, the red dress with the blue bows, the overalls and blue shirt recalling Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Part of me wanted her to just keep murdering her way to NYC and stardom, rather than sink into regret and hatred at the farm.",
