Despite it's silliness, the characters all just so loveable and well developed. Lots of action and spy stuff, yes, but its true strength is as a romance. Highlights are the hype as fuck twist at the end of season 2, and the ending which may just be the most bittersweet ending I've ever seen. Sooo bitter... and oh so sweet.",

I\u2019ve always been a fan of James Marsden and he absolutely did not disappoint here. But as everyone who\u2019s watched it can attest, Ronald is the absolute best. Easily my favorite thing I\u2019ve watched all year. \n\n**The Afterparty:** Big fan of the first season, going to give season 2 a chance even though episode 1 didn\u2019t give me a lot to love (aside from the phenomenal cast). Still not the biggest Sam Richardson fan, but just like in season 1, I love everyone around him so much that I\u2019ll let it slide. Poppy Liu is one of my favorite parts of Hacks, Elizabeth Perkins is a delight as the groom\u2019s mom, but I\u2019m surprised to report that Zach Woods was the first episode MVP for me - he got almost all of my laughs of the premiere. Let\u2019s go, season 2!\n- With John Gemberling popping up as a waiter in this episode and Ilana Glazer in the season 1 ensemble, I expect to get either Abbi Jacobson or Hannibal Burress in season 3.\n\n**The Righteous Gemstones:** one of the most anticipated returning shows of the year for me and it\u2019s living up to its hype. I haven\u2019t watched the episode that aired today (Sunday) yet, but was absolutely delighted by last week\u2019s episode. As with every season, the flashback interlude episodes provided a lot of meaningful context to the story of the season and fleshed out a lot of the season\u2019s most important players. I love Steve Zahn and he\u2019s fucking excellent in this. This season leaning harder into the fact that yes, the Gemstones suck is working very well, and seeing more of Eli\u2019s past continues to push John Goodman\u2019s performance into new heights. Not sure how this show is flying so under the radar with the level of comedic talent it has, but here we are.\n- also, whoever is playing young Jesse in this flashback should be put on retainer by Danny McBride to play younger versions of him whenever the need arises. It was actually almost spooky how well he completely captured Danny McBride.\n\n**Spy x Family:** We finished the last of the available episodes (season 1) the other day and I\u2019m sad I have no more to watch. I need a shirt with Smug Anya face on it ASAP.",

Although I must admit some of the gravity was lost on me because I was watching it whilst also doing work, and definitely missed some points.

Me? I love sci fi!! Have you watched the leftovers? It's great / not sure if I'd recommend From, but I like it enough.   (Deadloch is great too!!!)",

The series gets *really* intense from about episode five to seven, and then stumbles a bit in the final episode. I didn't fully understand how some of the side plots fit into the story, like the rich woman and her brother. Still, it's worth seeing for anyone who likes mysteries.\n\n* **Secret Invasion** \u2014 It's still mostly people sitting in rooms talking, but at least stuff happened in the latest episode.\n\n* **Never Have I Ever** \u2014 It's not exactly aimed at my demographic, but I'm really enjoying this. It's funny and heartfelt, and the characters are interesting and multifaceted. \n\nThis week, I'll probably start **The Afterparty** season two and **Foundation** season two. **Witcher** season three is on the list too.

I didn't fully understand how some of the side plots fit into the story, like the rich woman and her brother. Still, it's worth seeing for anyone who likes mysteries.\n\nThe ramp up from something kind of quirky and frothy to something so intense and dark and densely woven was both really shocking and really well executed. I felt like it ratcheted up so carefully that when all the parts suddenly fit together like a trap, I felt outplayed rather cheated, because the groundwork *was* laid down all along, a lot of stuff that felt like inconsequential throwaway gags suddenly had serious consequences after ep 5 or so. It's worth a rewatch actually, because the early episodes have a lot of stuff built in I hadn't caught first time around.\n\nTo go from a show where the first suspect is a really endearingly bad comedy seal puppet to one where for a moment there was a very real threat of >!women getting lynched by a mob!<, without feeling totally disjointed, was quite something.\n\nI thought it was fantastic, I couldn't believe how well the absurd comedy cohered with the quite dark themes and statements at the heart of it.",

            "body": "**Interview with a Vampire** on AMC+ Prime Day had some sales and I splurged on this channel. Holy cow, this show is great.  I would describe the mood as \"indulgent\" meaning both luxurious settings and a moody, self-serious tone that teeters on ridiculous at times (that's Anne Rice for ya, though) but never tips over into silly. Whoever they found for Lestat is *unbelievably* charismatic and attractive, (despite his terrible hair/wig, come on show) and I love the layering of having the Louis character be black and the setting in the early 1900s. It's also much more explicit about Louis and Lestat being gay/together whereas the 90s movie just dabbled in that aspect or hinted at it because Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise would never. It's got gore and nudity, so I'd rate this a \"hard R\" just FYI, but it's a gorgeous show that's a really fun watch. \n\n**Kaleidoscope** on Netflix- contrary to most reviews, I found this a fun, if by the numbers, heist series. It hits all the tropes and goes through the paces and is 100% predictable and typical, which to me is the fun part. It's not groundbreaking in any way, but it's great background tv. \n\n**Hack my House** on Netflix. Oh my goodness, what a fun hidden gem. I skip through some slightly irritating parts where the team natters through their ideas and/or banters for the camera, or they coach confused 6 year olds into saying they're \"so excited\", but I *love* seeing the cool, innovative ideas and transformations. The only thing that bothers me is remote-control panels for really key things like walls that open to reveal office spaces--those are destined to break like 2 years from now and be HUGELY expensive to repair. But eh, it's good tv. \n\n[**Selected Sessions Aaron Hibell, Iceland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFehguB4WFI) on Youtube. Whoever made [this trailer](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtcQwvIIsWh/) is an absolute genius because I had chills. Aaron Hibell in a tie dye puffy parka with his 90s hearthrob middle-part hairdo being deadly self-serious on his equipment is *just* this side of silly but the music is otherworldly gorgeous and has a soaring, ecstatic sound that is perfectly suited to the venue. The actual Twilight Zone song is a let down, but that preview is something else. If you like techno/EDM check it out. Beautiful stuff from a really talented artist.",

As a contrasting viewpoint, I'd say season 2 was made with more focus on the core philosophy of the show (albeit sometimes beating you over the head with it): EVERY SECOND COUNTS. There's a lot of good messages to be found in this season. One being, every detail matters (usually visually represented attention to detail in cooking ingredients). But you see this principle in the cinematography as well, with very very detailed and beautifully considered/composed shots. The other idea is that, just like a fine restaurant can't make a high class dish without investing in great ingredients, the theme of investing in characters is strong here too. Sending them to school or to study abroad, or giving them a long leash to discover themselves, it's all very resonant of great personal philosophy. Experimentation and creativity are also on the podium in this season. In the end, it was an investment season, so it's never gonna be the best season... but it was a good one for sure!

You've successfully hooked me in for another couple months of subscribing in the future, Peacock (whenever season 2 comes out, that is... not sure how that's being affected by the current strikes).\n\nThe season as a whole was a little uneven, but that's almost impossible to avoid when you have a show that's so case-of-the-week. Inevitably some are going to be better than others. It made me realize that heavily serialized storytelling in TV shows can almost be like a crutch sometimes, because even if you have some episodes that are less compelling here and there, they still have you hooked due to the ongoing plot threads. Overall I had a great time with Poker Face though. It's an easy recommendation to anyone who has ever enjoyed this genre of TV show.\n\nSidenote: Does the video quality on Peacock seem a little sub-par to anyone else? I was watching Poker Face in 4K but something seemed off in the compression or something and it wasn't as crisp as shows I've watched on, say, Netflix or Apple TV+. Didn't really impact my enjoyment of the show but just curious if that jumped out at anyone else. (And to be fair, Poker Face is the only show I've watched on that service so far, so it might not be Peacock-wide.)\n\nI'm also back on **For All Mankind** now after a short hiatus between seasons 1 and 2. Only three episodes in, but I like the time jump, and it's cool to see the show veering farther into the alt-history/sci-fi stuff. Very curious to see where some of these storylines are going, and which characters are going to get the most focus. Seems to be mainly Ed and Margo, but Ellen seems to be taking more of a central role so far as well.",

I almost wish there was an abridged version where they turned each season into a TV movie or something. \n\nI remember being intrigued by the initial premise in the first season. The second season war with the mountain was great of course. I always loved Murphy's trek through the desert and always felt like the island and the lighthouse could've led to more intrigue than it did. I liked the kind of hippy look to the outside settings after the 5 year jump. And the look of the settlement when they went to the new planet in season 6. Actually, season 6 and some of 7 might've been my favorites in the show. The ending...well maybe there was no good way to end it. I am sure it didn't help that Bellamy's actor turned out to be an ass.",

The editing too is so cheap that every cut is like something come from different places and sometimes there are scenes with voice off the camera that are so strange like they put some patch here and there. And the music, it's always like an atomic bomb is exploding, you kill a man or drink a coffee, don't worry the music is overtune and always there.\n\nAnd the script. Seriously everything has so little credibility, like they shot the president, he goes to the hospital and it seems like me and my father when he broke his leg. Three doctors, a body guard, nothing outside. Where is the rest of the world in all that? Everything is so confusing. The colonel convinced the president to do a strike to Russia and start a WW3 by sending a confused satellite photo on a TV for two seconds? Ok Trump happened so maybe it's realistic but there is no weight to anything, the action scenes are bland and generic, everything is so lazy, it's incredible.\n\nIt's really a bad show, bad thought, bad done, I love the actors but they can't save this shit even if Olivia Colman is so great that every time she graces us with 5 great minutes, that's all.

It's different, but still interesting and thrilling. It's almost what you'd logically expect to happen to Joe after what's he's done/been through. Maybe a little surreal, a little too much MC armor. This is good to binge watch.\n\nNeither of these are a waste of time",

It was so good, so glad I watched. I thought I would be super pumped to start watching Better Call Saul, but it's been especially boring. I'm mid season 2 and it's not very exciting.

With such a build-up heavy style of TV the ending matters a lot, so it does kinda lessen the impact of a lot of the earlier episodes. Still pretty good tho.\n\n6.5/10\n\n#1899\n\nSurprised to see this is from the creators of Dark. Dark is amazing, this.. not so much. Pretty decent mystery, but expected more. A lot of the time it feels like it's throwing random shit at the viewer for no real reason (\"From\" style) just to be mysterious. I'd say whether it's worth a watch depends on how S2 goes, some cool ideas in there and a pretty interesting ending. \n\n6.25/10\n\n#Castle Rock\n\nIf you're gonna make a show this *sslloooowww* it better be going somewhere real cool. Unfortunately, this is a bit too much of a drag for a little too little of a reward, a lot of build up to a meh ending. I'm sure they'll explain more in S2, but I don't think I'll be watching. + >!I hate multiverse shit, fuck multiverse shit!<. Also I never thought I'd complain about this, but jesus it's like sad event after sad event after sad event.. idk if \"too grim\" is valid criticism, but it sure felt like it. I guess if you're a big Stephen King fan it might be worth a watch, but otherwise ehhh. \n\n6/10",

One of the great and unique shows of this generation, I hope it doesn't end up like Archer or The Simpsons and run into the ground long past its best-by date.\n\n**Foundation Season 2 (Apple TV)** Had mixed-at-best feelings about this show from Season 1 but got sucked in by the trailer for this season. S02E01 just had all the same problems as Season 1: a lack of meaningful plot stakes, mediocre secondary story lines with mediocre actors and just overall narrative confusion. A big fan of this book series as a kid, I just don't think the story is good adaptation material. The sets and backgrounds look like a million bucks but the actual scenes all take place in a few rooms that host dull action scenes. Another painful trope of this series are the main characters solving computer/logic puzzles while shouting out mathematical terms to an audience surrogate, it's just such a bizarre story choice. Not continuing with this one, it's a mediocre SyFy show from last geneation dressed up with an Apple TV budget. Even my wife, who has a high tolerance for this sort of show, is out.",

Not a fan of her acting, the attitude, those pauses she takes when talking, she's arrogant and annoying in general. I'm sorry, I don't like that character/actress.",

Still, despite our differing views, The Bear s2 is one of the strongest seasons of television in recent history.\n\nI agree with your comments about Syd. Weakest character by far. She hasn't earned the right to act the way she does to the characters in the show, yet they all seem to give her reverence anyway. It's very strange.",
