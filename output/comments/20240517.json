Other than a great jab at the Dallas Cowboys by Melissa, Jacob was the only one who reliably made me laugh this week. I\u2019m officially over the typical sitcom \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they\u201d (spoiler alert: they will, but only after making us sit through a bunch of contrived nonsense about why they shouldn\u2019t). In the past, Abbott field trips have been some of my favorite episodes of the show, but this one was one of the weakest episodes of all. Even Michaela Watkins couldn\u2019t save it for me and she made me laugh to the point of tears the other night when she appeared on @fter Midnight. I hope the season finale has more to offer than this week\u2019s episode.\n\n**Under the Bridge:** I\u2019ve never seen Anoop Desai (Reena\u2019s uncle Raj) in anything else, but I sincerely hope this is only the first of many incredible performances I see from him. He gave me *chills* this week in his scene in the car with Suman and in a great episode, this was a standout scene. Speaking of chilling performances - the girl that plays Kelly. Wow. >!If we\u2019re comparing teenage sociopaths in miniseries, this girl would fit right into Sharp Objects. My jaw actually dropped as she spoke to Suman in the grocery store, and it dropped again as she tried to convince Dusty to jump onto the tracks and kill herself.!< I have to say again that Rebecca and Cam are the least interesting part of this show to me. That\u2019s\nnot to say that Riley Keough or Lily Gladstone are giving bad performances, because they\u2019re not - both are incredible actresses doing the best with what they\u2019ve been given, but the writing is just not particularly strong for either. Not to mention that the younger actors (and all of the actors that play the Virk family members) have consistently brought it and the story is at its most compelling when they\u2019re front and center.\n- speaking of the younger cast: Javon \u201cWanna\u201d Walton\u2019s character on Euphoria frustrated me, but here he gets to show off a level of depth that he didn\u2019t get to playing Ashtray. I hope he continues to take on interesting roles that give him a chance to show his chops, because he\u2019s great in this.\n- Lastly, the needledrops in this show never disappoint. This week we had \u201cEvery Me Every You\u201d by Placebo and \u201cBetween the Bars\u201d by Elliott Smith. Could we have really called this a miniseries set in the 90s without E.S. appearing somewhere?\n\n**X-Men 97:** what a finale to end an incredible season of television. I\u2019ve gotta say though, >!my SO and I both were really confused as to how Jubilee was faring so well out in space without even a helmet. I can buy that Roberto was fine given his powers, but Jubilee? It felt a little jarring seeing her out there and not struggling in the slightest.!< but I\u2019m nitpicking, I know, because I don\u2019t have a ton to say aside from the fact that it was great and set up what seems will be a verrrrry interesting season 2.\n\n**Hacks:** The hardest I\u2019ve laughed all week is Ava and Deborah >!screaming \u201cwhy are you doing this to me? I don\u2019t even know you!\u201d in perfect unison. And then Deborah made me cry almost instantly made me sob with her speech about growing older.!<  This show (and its two leading ladies) are truly something special. This week\u2019s episodes may be some of my favorites of the entire series.\n- I can\u2019t not talk about that gender reveal party. Kaitlin Olson has been perfect this season. This show just gives and gives to its cast.\n- Speaking of being excellent this season, Hannah Einbinder is definitely getting an Emmy nom for this season\u2019s performance, right? Ava has been on fire this season.",

I decided to rewatch before jumping into season 2 and I\u2019m so glad I did! I still love it\u2026 and now it makes perfect sense why I couldn\u2019t remember anything, lol. \n\nHaving just finished season 2, it feels like they turned down the weird this season\u2026 which is disappointing for me. The main draws of season 1 for me were the mysteries, poetic monologues, deciphering metaphors, and the trippy visuals. It felt like season 1 leaned hard into the theatrical vibes, while season 2 is a bit more realistic in tone. \n\nThat being said, I still love the show. Many of the \u201cshort term\u201d reveals are telegraphed through foreshadowing, which makes it fun to theorize and predict as you watch. But at the same time, I enjoy that I have no concrete idea what the big picture/long game of this show is. It\u2019s a show that begs for discussion, which is why I\u2019m kinda disappointed they dropped the entire season 2 at once. I thought the 2 episodes per week release schedule of season 1 was perfect. \n\nDefinitely recommend checking it out, if you haven\u2019t already!",

Mad Men and Halt and Catch Fire come to mind as well but the 'details' are often just scenes where a key moment of charisma from our protagonist advances their business empire but they're not entirely unrealistic.\n\nA quality written show will usually get any business related plot points right and in an interesting way, The Wire and Deadwood come to mind but a lot of it centers around drugs of various types. Deadwood is an all timer show anyway and i'd recommend it to anyone, it does feature a lot of small businesses as they take hold in a new town.\n\nAl Swearengen was great at customer service https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=907-kcW_ohI",

It's a show I started after S2 had already aired and I was just working my way through the Apple TV catalog and I really just fell in love with it. For me, a true test of how much I *actually* liked something is that when I'm finished the show (or caught up), I genuinely get a bit depressed and miss the show. I was genuinely sad when I finished it because I missed it. Lighthearted, funny, lovable characters, this is like Ted Lasso but in Mexico at a hotel. \n\n**Dark Matter** - I just watched all 3 episodes this weekend, I really enjoyed it. Not a book reader so I can't compare the two, but I'm hooked in and will ride it out. \n\n**Trying** - I finally got around to starting this as well this weekend. Watched the first 5-6 episodes and really enjoyed this so far as well. Apple does a great job making little short episode drama-dy shows with likable characters to latch on to and root for. \n\n**Survivor** - I usually don't post anything about Survivor here, but I've seen it popping up recently, and this show is just so fun. They're on Survivor 46 now, and there's a reason it's been around so long. Good drama, fun challenges, fun and interesting gamesmanship dynamics, and this season is one of the better modern-era ones imo.",

            "body": "**The Valley (Bravo, Peacock):** Honestly...I could write a book about this show. Maybe I'm just the exact target demo for it or something? The montages of people just doing very ordinary stuff (building cribs, having pool parties) but also the gossip and reality show drama and the interesting (downright fascinating in some cases) dynamics of the couples and men vs. women is riveting. The hook of the show is \"how do selfish, amoral Hollywood party people act when they have children/get married?\" (except Nia and Danny, protect them at all costs) has much more leg than I would have credited it with at first. I also LOVE the way they're breaking the fourth wall here and there--like the open admission that gossip is fueling them. For example, Janet quits her \"day job\" while pregnant and her husband correctly twigs that her new full time job is gossiping and being on reality tv.\n\n**Tokyo Vice (HBO):** I fizzled out of this 4 episodes in but picked it back up recently. I struggle with the main character, I find him kind of a Marty Stew, but everyone else on the show is doing incredible work. The other issue I had is with the violence--a lot of it isn't just gory or upsetting, it's psychologically disturbing as well. There's a difference between a punch out or a gunfight vs. a scene where someone tries to cut off their own finger as a sacrifice because of a minor mistake to their boss. However, this show is unlike anything else on TV and I'm interested for Season 2.\n\n**The Asunta Case (Netflix):** even with English dubbing, I found this hard to follow. I suspect there are deeply ingrained cultural issues at play that an American audience just doesn't get, like the way a judge is also an investigator, and the significance of a local couple adopting an Asian child, etc. I just found it tough to get into and follow.\n\n**NOS4A2 (Amazon Prime purchase):** this is decent. It's genuinely scary at least to me--the corruption of Christmas especially. I'm only on episode 1, though. I will pretty much watch any Zachary Quinto performance, he's so good, even if he does chew scenery a bit at times. He's the 2000s Vincent Price, IMHO. The show has its flaws, and it has a touch of that \"WB/CW\" feeling that's hard to pinpoint (some of the production choices mostly) that brings the overall quality down, but it's fun.\n\n**A Man in Full (Netflix):** I'm very on the fence about this show. It's like Succession is the Grandfather OG, Billions is the Son, and this is the Grandson, each version getting less well done and more soapy and histrionic. I don't get some of the directing choices here (or production/writing/whatever). Firstly, I need much more build up to give 2 shits about the fight between the bank and the main character. Also, shows without any likable characters or even morally good characters can absolutely succeed but I detest everyone in this show, and not even in a love to hate or entertaining way. I really wanted to like this, I like Jeff Daniels a lot, and Tom Pelphray is doing interesting work (although I think no one is in the same show in terms of performance, frankly) but this just...isn't hitting.",

This is just a really well-made show and if anyone even has a tiny interest in a Samurai show, they should go watch this ASAP. It ends in a way that could close the door on only having one season but luckily they've already announced Season 2. Can't wait!\n\nThe show also made me realize something...\n\nTHIS is what George Lucas was trying to emulate in his Prequel movies. I'm convinced with the stoic conversation, minimalist dialogue, and subdued emotions, George *desperately* wanted to have his Jedi be the model of Western Samurai and it failed miserably because he doesn't understand WHY the dialogue is the way it is for these types of movies (Eastern vs. Western culture exists and George learned all the wrong lessons from it).",

I regret doing that, I should've watched in order because some themes are better explained during the first season. Either way I was gobsmacked by the first episodes, the cinematography and the concepts were so cool, I was getting True Detective vibes, however, the last episodes got really confusing; I think they leaned way too much on the hallucinations, etc. even though I know that's sort of the point; I would've liked something a bit more straightforward.\n* **Them (S1)**: I've read bad things about this, that it's unbearable to watch at points because of the violence, that it's border torture p\\*rn, etc. but I actually thought it was okay, I think I liked it more than S1, it's a bit more straightforward (still confusing at points tho).\n* **Sugar**: Really excited with the first episode, looked like a really fun neo-noire detective TV show and Colin Farrel is always nice to see... however episode 2 and 3 start to have really bad pacing, show becomes boring... kept watching because of the hype for THAT episode, thought the reveal was cool but couldn't care much more for the show afterwards... just finished it and it's alright I guess.\n* **Shogun**: Only watched two episodes. Everyone here is amazed by the show and I think the production quality is extremely good, I'm enjoying it but I don't feel hooked or amazed, I wonder what they're going to do with just one season though... feels like a kinda show that should span many seasons.\n* **Baby Reindeer**: I watched some of this because everyone in my circle was doing that but I just couldn't care too much about the story tbh, it's really short and the acting is good though so I might just finish it one of these days.\n\nIf I might take some recommendations... do you know a sort of \"rags to riches\" story? I love things like the first season Breaking Bad where well... Walt breaks bad and starts his way to become a drug lord, anything similar? Doesn't have to be about crime.",

I respect you might not have loved certain aspects of it but as someone who loves it I wouldnt want it cut down or shortened. 3 seasons seems perfect for the story they laid out and wanted to tell.\u00a0 As for the actors I think it might be one of the most well casted shows I\u2019ve ever seen.

Basically, Penelope Wilton, as the Miss Marple character, hands him the reins to solve several mysterious deaths in her tiny village. Now, Luke is about a 28 year old Nigerian just off the boat to start his new job at Whitehall. So, this little, old, very sweet, white lady wants him to go to an all-white, tiny English village and solve a murder. Lol!! Love. It. His co-conspirator & love interest Bridget played by Morfydd Clark is so beautiful and sexy and I know I've seen her in something else but I just can't put my finger on it. And we actually get to see 1950s young Nigerian culture, which I've never heard of before in any of the English productions I have ever seen. This was season 1 which is only two episodes so Amazon better make a season 2! It's really an intelligent and refreshing new update.\n\n\nEdit:\u00a0 Morfydd Clark played the obsessed Galadriel in The Rings of Power. God she was so great in that!",

I think this show had the kernels of success inside it (fun irreverent tone, good cast chemistry) but they really, really, needed to compress this show down to fewer episodes and a shorter runtime per episode and preferably both. Too many long, long scenes where nothing happens followed by a few spectacular set pieces where the budget obviously went. This show got cancelled but I think there is a niche here for a more adult/comedy version of the usual cop/special forces genre stuff (**Lioness?** haven't seen it). Anyways, if you are just looking for nudity, raunch, and an unfiltered celebration of hard drug use this is certainly the show for you, although I couldn't get through it by about episode 6, even only half watching. This might have been better as a movie.\n\n**Fat Rascal (Netflix)** Never listened to the Cumtown podcast but I've certainly seen more than a few clips of Matty Mathe... err.. Stavros Halkias here and there. This special, unfortunately, has an incredibly long-winded and unfunny story about Stavros being an asshole at an airport that might be one of the worst bits I've ever seen in a standup. If I was in a different mood I would have powered through because the rest of the special was pretty funny but that bit was awful. Also a bit of a cheap-looking production as well.",

Some episodes this season didn't click with me well like *Lice Capades*, *D-Yikes!*, and *Night of the Living Homeless*.
