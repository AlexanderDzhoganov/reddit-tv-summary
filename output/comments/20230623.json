That really resonated with me.\n\nLike in the seventh episode, \"Forks,\" where the chef was talking about the couple who were saving up to dine there, and he said something like, \"and at the end, I don't want a check dropped on them. I want to blow their fucking minds.\" Sure, someone could see it cynically as just wanting the customers to spread good word of mouth, but it really didn't seem like it. The chef just wanted them to have an incredible experience and be taken care of. \n\nAnd then going above and beyond to get the deep dish pizza. Or what gets given to Cicero later. Just awesome. It's definitely affected me in the short-term, rekindling those desires to, like you said, get my shit together and do something *more*.",

A lot of it is slightly nostalgic and occasionally jaunty music like Wilco and R.E.M, and some slower stuff by Pearl Jam, Weezer, Radiohead, etc. There's lots of piano and acoustic guitar, and I dunno, it's like cool breeze of air compared to how high-pressure things get in the restaurant. It's a nice contrast.\n\nThere's of course also some hip-hop and electronica, too, but I just thought some of the ballad-y, mid-temp piano and guitar tunes built a great backbone of the soundtrack.",

Jason Segel I didn\u2019t really know (although I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen him in other things.) He has a wider range and I found myself loving his performance. The women are very strong - Jessica Williams is riotously funny throughout; Christa Miller\u2019s character is excellent, and Lukita Maxwell as the daughter is endearing and quite true and believable, even within the comic style.\n\nThere was something very touching about the series and it\u2019s gentle exploration of grief. It\u2019s not in-your-face and bleak like Ricky Gervais\u2019 wonderful series After Life. It\u2019s more a lovely ride, easy but intelligent laughs, and a sense of warmth and generosity. It\u2019s nice that the show isn\u2019t too cynical.\n\n**Outlander** S07E01\n\nOff to a good start the new season. It\u2019s a bit of a romp, but I have always loved Outlander, for lots and lots of reasons - it\u2019s music is one of them. Not sure I like the newest version of the theme tune though!\n\n**The Great** S02E01\n\nJust love this series. It fizzes with energy and always make me laugh.\n\n**Drops of God** S01E01\n\nNow THAT is a good first episode. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect, but something about it absolutely gripped me. A great concept, a lovely lead, a good script, beautiful design etc. Can\u2019t wait to watch more, what a winner (I hope.)",

I especially liked those scenes that seem to stretch time, where you get closer and deeper with the characters. Which is not a difficult task, since these people like to talk about their feelings, A LOT. Anyway, lovely cast and writing and editing and blabla. I get 1970's vibes from this show, I wonder if that's a conscious decision from the creators. I mean in terms of themes, it being so character-driven, the performance styles, the setting. Also kudos to Will Poulter in Denmark, such a naturalistic performance. Here's your Emmy.\n\n**Strange new worlds s02e02**. As a non-trekky (I'm not even sure if that's the way you write it) I'm in the privileged position of objectively attesting the amazingness of this particular episode. Instant classic. Such a beautiful script and delivery. Lovely all around.\n\nI've been rewatching (and watching some episodes I didn't watch the first time around) **High Maintenance**, which to me is a very hit-and-miss kind of show. The good news is that there are so many episodes, you just skip the ones that don't resonante with you. I wonder if this show reflects accurately the experience of living in NY. It looks like it. And it very much works as an anti-add to me in that sense. This Ben Sinclair guy is really talented btw.\n\nI've been thinking of rewatching some of the Ewan McGregor/Charley Boorman shows, but maybe there's something similar out there that I have not watched?",

It's just fun watching him get a Big Year on NatGeo's dime.\n\n***Secret Invasion*** (Disney+). Not quite grabbing me yet, but early days. Lotta *plot,* kinda light on character, but s'MCU, so kinda par for the course. I did feel a *little* like I'd missed a movie or something between this and *Captain Marvel,* since we are mostly jumping straight from 1995 to the present day.\n\n***Happy Valley S3*** (BBC America/AMC+/AcornTV).

It's kind of the quintessential '60s genre mashup: Western, Spy, and Science Fiction.

Currently, I'm in the middle of Season 3, and while it's starting to feel a bit repetitive (love daddy - hate daddy), I'm aware that it will conclude in a dozen episodes, so I don't mind at all. I simply found it masterfully crafted, I really hate everyone and let's see how they cook them.\n\nEnded\n\n**From**, it's a different story. It's not great, and I'd rather not delve into any discussions about the ending to avoid spoilers. However, I found Season 1 to be decent and easily binge-worthy, but unfortunately, it ended on a terrible cliffhanger that wasn't followed up with a satisfying Season 2. About 90% of Season 2 is just garbage, with only a few decent hours scattered here and there, mostly in the last two episodes, which hardly justifies the time invested in the show. I'm unsure if it has been renewed yet; there are conflicting rumors, some saying yes while others claim the decision is still pending. The ongoing strike further complicates matters, and I doubt we'll receive any answers anytime soon, if at all. The potential for a great mystery was there, maybe, but the majority of the actors (honestly I laughed at actors screaming at the end of the final episode), directors, and writers involved are accurately selected from the bottom of the barrel. Certain parts felt like a Gene Cousineau class... Cheap, in every aspect...\n\n**Heavenly delusion - Tengoku Daimakyo**\n\nThe storytelling is exceptional, the animation is top-notch, and the mystery is captivating. The pacing is good, and the characters are well-developed. The music and overall production are also outstanding. This animation series manages to make even unrealistic events feel realistic, engaging and never boring, which is a sign of quality with an satisficing ending that reveals some part of the story while maintaining a decent amount of secrets. It's the last of us meet Akira. Obviously you need to accept anime as a TV series like every other genera and it's nothing that will change your life but for me it was a very good surprise and it's everything that From failed to be.",

I'd also consider **Better Call Saul** if you love **Breaking Bad** as its obviously very similar and its a long series total hour wise.",

The boys is very good as well, allthough no match for game of thrones and it's not the same lore either.\n\nThe sopranos is a cult classic. Mafia movies were a thing in the nineties and this is a series. It's really good, but it's old. I loved it when it aired, I tried rewatching it lately and I didn't really care for it anymore.\n\nHaven't seen the others you mentioned, saw the shield passing by once in a while, not that bad, but not exactly binge watch material imo.",

If you could package anxiety into 30 minutes and put it on TV, it would be this show.\n* **Silo:**  Only one more to go here, it's been a bit uneven but I've enjoyed the world-building.\n* **The Righteous Gemstones:**  It's like a dumber and more religious version of Succession.  I love it.\n* **Black Mirror:**  We've gotten through the first episode, I enjoyed it, I liked the twist at the end.\n* **Secret Invasion:**  The first episode was what some would call a \"slow burn.\"  I'll watch anything with Samuel L. Jackson in this, and I'm enjoying it so far.\n* **Platonic:**  We watched the first episode of this, enjoyed it, but it's kind of at the bottom of our current watch list.\n\n*Finished*\n\n* **Ted Lasso:**  Not much to add to the discussion here.  I found the third (and final?) season to be a bit up-and-down.\n* **Yellowjackets:**  We binged this pretty aggressively, but it felt like the last couple of episodes really went in a different direction.  The casting on this show has been generally stellar, however the adult version of Lottie felt like an entirely new character.\n* **Jury Duty:**  This slipped under our radar when it came out initially, and we checked it out based on the premise.  It was a fun and enjoyable show, a bit unbelievable but an easy watch nonetheless.\n* **I Think You Should Leave:**  Another very solid season, but with run-times of 10-15 minutes and only 6 episodes, it's very short.  On the bright side, rewatch!\n\n*On Deck*\n\n* **What We Do In The Shadows:**  Looking forward to this.\n* **Justified City Primeval:**  The return of Raylan Givens!\n\n*Bonus Cartoon Corner*\n\n* **Bob's Burgers:**  We actually had the chance to visit a \"Bob's Bargers\" popup bar a few weeks ago, and it was awesome.  The show has been going strong for awhile.  This is a show we watch to relax and unwind.",

A weird mix of crime/mystery and regular drama but I felt like it handled and blended those elements really well and delivered a story that was pretty fresh and that went in an unexpected direction.

If you do not like her then it is like you are watching Dexter and not liking Michael C Hall so it might be hard for you to watch.\n\nThe actors playing sheriff and wife are good so I understand if you feel sad about the sudden change but plot wise it make sense.\n\nEpisode 3 is a little different and not going in the direction of the main mystery but it is definitely not boring. I was till glue to it for the whole episode. And the ending of the episode is sad but exciting too.

Still pretty fun and definitely worth a watch.\n\n7.5/10\n\nBloodhounds - Mildly entertaining, although I was baited by high reviews, when it's actually very average. Don't know if it's a cultural thing but these asian/korean shows have many tropes and refuse to get \"realer\" than a baseline pg-13 level of drama. The acting is also pretty amateur in general.\n\n5/10\n\nTed Lasso S3 - Still wholesome good fun but a very clear dropoff in quality from the first 2 seasons. They insist on everyone being amazing and flawless and it just is a little boring. Nate's character was set up for such a better arc and it was just wasted by some typical self-righteousness and a boring romance. Also the pandering was comically over the top this season.\n\n6/10",

Not a flawless show by any means, but I'm not surprised to see it apparently has a gazillion seasons. Currently on season 3\r  \n\r  \n*On the fence*\r  \n\r  \n**Never Have I Ever s4:** while I have a huge soft spot for this show and was excited to see its return, I cannot stand a certain character and since I can see where this is heading my binge has gone from sprinting to a screeching halt. I'll probably finish it at some point but not right now\r  \n\r  \n**Somebody Somewhere s2:** I've watched two episodes, but I'm not super fond of titty humor and I don't have the patience right now to tolerate it for the sake of the show's heart, which I do like  \n\r  \n**Industry:** I've barely finished the pilot and I'm not hooked even a little. The only character I'm even mildly intrigued by is the toilet stall sleeper. Is this a good show? Should I keep going?\r  \n\r  \n*No, I'm good*\r  \n\r  \n**Secret Invasion:** the only thing episode one accomplished was making me wonder whether I should rewatch AoS. After such a mediocre start, I have no interest in watching more\r  \n\r  \n**The Lake:** I've watched one episode, but this just doesn't feel particularly well written. Exposition delivered through clunky dialogue is a terrible start and life's too short etc",

I have just finished binge-watching all four seasons, and I have so many thoughts that cannot simply be summarized as \"liking it.\" It was a challenging series to watch; I found myself disliking almost every character, cringing at their actions, laughing, feeling disdain for them and for myself numerous times. The show was undeniably interesting, but I don't think I could bring myself to watch it again.\n\nI was satisfied with how it ended, although I struggle to accept the fact that the \"loser\" or \"losers\" actually amassed billions by engaging in reprehensible and dumb and unprofessional behaviors. At least they didn't emerge as outright \"winners\", which aligns with the show's intended message. However, this left me feeling quite uncomfortable and left a bitter taste in my mouth. It also bothered me that there were countless online discussions about who was the audience favorite. From the first episode, I had hoped that all the characters would end up in jail, and it saddened me >!that one of the most detestable ones met an too early demise!<\n\nWould I recommend the show? Absolutely, it's really well-crafted. Did I enjoy it? Well, considering I binge-watched four seasons in just a week, I would say yes. Is it a good show? Definitely. Nevertheless, I can't shake off this feeling of unease, and I know I won't look back on it as a pleasant time spent. Honestly, I'm unsure if I've gained any profound insights from it beyond mere entertainment. Yes rich people are bad, vicious and money tarnishes everything but... ok, I guess? Didn't we already know that? Perhaps the show lacked depth, or maybe it did have some deeper meaning that I have yet to fully comprehend. Or, it's just a fucking well made show and that's it.",
