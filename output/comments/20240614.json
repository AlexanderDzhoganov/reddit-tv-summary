                    "body": "The first 3 episodes were great, I've missed this show.\n\nOver on /r/theboys most people are complaining about Frenchie's story thus far and how it feels like out of the blue or unnecessary. Even though it has been clearly established that Frenchie did a lot of fucked up things in his past life that he's still reckoning with. There was the shit with Little Nina last season and now what's going on with him and Colin. They're also surprised he's bisexual, despite that having been clearly alluded to in prior episodes. They're all uppity that he and Kimiko don't just get together.\n\nIn my opinion they have a finality to this show now ending with season 5. And they may want a good ending for it, which could mean Frenchie and Kimiko do get together and find a way to accept themselves and the terrible things they've done, they've seen and they've had done to them. Or maybe Frenchie's long-term arc is to sacrifice his life for something good instead of doing something bad. The whole time in the run of the show he's been dependent on drugs, alcohol etc to cope with everything. The showrunner's not just gonna whisk all that away and make him fucking Pepe le Pew. It's like viewers don't have a sense of long-term plotlines and how small-term plots feed into them, which is exactly the point with this Colin guy. It's like Frenchie has no way out of what he's done since he's affected so many people. And Kimiko is literally mute because of what happened to her. It's like viewers have 0 sense of nuance. Frenchie calling Ch\u00e9rie, from season 1 and 2 (I think) is him trying to go back to his old ways to try and cope with himself.\n\nAre they a match made in heaven? Fuck no! But they have each other, for better or for worse, in the capacity that's right for them at the present moment in the show. I don't expect the shippers to ever be happy because the second a fandom like that gets what they want in a show, the show turns to shit. See: Arrow.\n\nI expect Frenchie will come clean to Colin and he will lose him. But Kimiko will be there for him like he has been for her. I do expect that he will die or they'll die together, but it remains to be seen. All I know is that people need to be more fucking patient and just let the story happen. And for people who think Frenchie is useless or whatever, need I remind you in the *first* episode of S4 he's literally making some chemical to kill Neumann, which is what he's good at. Still seem pretty useless? Or do you think MM, Starlight, Butcher, Hughie or Kimiko could do that?\n\nAnyway, can't wait for the next episode to see where they take things. Setting a time frame for when the show is due to end helps tidy up and constrain where long-term plots can go, and thus far very few scenes have been wasted. But again, it's like people don't know how to digest the show because it isn't immediately giving them what they want. Nobody has any complaints about MM's story with Monique and Janine (a story that's been going on for the whole runtime of the show), or Hughie and his parents (another plot thread that's been there the whole time), so what's the deal with Frenchie having his own story spanning the whole show and his past?",

I am always impressed with younger people who get stuff from before their time right - for example:  like almost everybody wore hard soled shoes and this is really part of the 'sound' of the era.\n\nRipley is an interesting character in that he is so lacking in complexity - it is paradoxically what makes him interesting - he uses his hollowness as a tool to manipulate the more complex people around him. In a lot of ways Andrew Scott is not being asked to give what would be a traditionally 'great' performance, but he has to empty himself out and all the fun comes out in the nuances of his reactions to things.  He  sees objects as things to care about and people as objects.  It is very clever how the show often uses faces of statues as sort of 'observers'  in  various shots - as Ripley would value them more than actual people.\n\nMy only complaint is that I think the show is about one episode too long....too much of a good thing makes you start to take it for granted.\n\nI gather from what I've read that its unlikely Netflix would put out the money for season 2 - too bad (Showtime initially funded the production then sold it to Netflix)",

Bill Camp is excellent as he always is.  Never read book or saw original so the 2 episode premiere has me intrigued. \n\n**Interview with the Vampire S2** - I\u2019d argue the best show on TV with likely the smallest viewership.

But on the other--how many TV shows and/or movies about the sad sack men behind the cheerful world of 1980s educational puppet shows does the world need? I **detest** Vincent's character and I'm actually kind of on his Dad's side (!?!) when he says he's tired of the revisionist history of his terrible childhood. He's a bad son, employee, father, husband, coworker, and friend. And citizen of NYC while we're at it. And I see *nothing* in the backstory that justifies this except his own self-inflicted addiction. Oh, wah, it's hard to guzzle down liquor around this silver spoon in my mouth. Gimmie a break. Anyway, I love the setting of 1980s NYC and the literal craft of the show is exceptional, so I'll hang with it even if I hate Vincent. \n\n**Succession** HBO, finally finished the show. After struggling not to cry my eyes out in the Palm Springs airport when I thought I would just distract myself with some amusing viewing over \"Connor's Wedding\" which was a gut punch due to a very similar situation in my own life, I set the show aside and said I would come back to it. A year later (!) I finally powered through the last few episodes. To me it's like the Sopranos. It just kept getting darker and more tragic and inevitable, and the delight of spending time in this world grew less (by intention of the show, I think!) until the end where you're left wanting more/feeling that it ended on exactly the right note/moment. \n\n**Couple's Therapy** Showtime via Paramount Plus. Ugh, I love Orna. I will watch her for as many seasons as they grace us with. Also Josh Mr. Throuple dude BOO. He's icky. Gives me the creeps. \n\n**Painkiller** on Netflix. This reminds me of something, but I can't put my finger on it (maybe Wolf of Wallstreet?) it feels like it's trying to be the much better Dopesick, but also be Dumb Money, Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short, but the topic itself is so dire and dark it's just not possible. Tonally all over the place and odd, doesn't quite get it right, but admittedly quite watchable. Also that scene where the addict rolls around in the strangely pristine bedsheet while the pharma girl has her Big Revelation is absolutlely 100% not giving what they thought it was giving, bless their hearts. It was giving Nickelback music video.\n\n**The Valley** on Peacock (also avail on Bravo) Holy SHIT what a masterpiece. The wages of sin. It is absolutely riveting watching these childish assholes struggle to be adults. I love it. \n\n**Real Housewives of Dubait** on Peacock. Okay, what is with these Ayan women (Ube from NYC and Chanel), I find them **insufferable** but the world appears to love them? Yes, they're stunning physically. But the performative \"I'm so great, I'm everything, darling, kiss my ass, and I'm a manic pixie dream diva\" is wearisome. Also, the barely concealed *rage* when they are questioned or crossed is upsetting! Carolyn Stansberry what is you doin' baby? That man has 1.5 brain cells and all of them are calculating calories! I have a morbid fascination with the corrupt depths and heights of ultra-wealthy Arab nations and their citizens so this show has me in it's grubby little paws right now.",

Disney keeps co-opting existing Star Wars cannon and making it in their own way which is essentially ruining it.  Some examples from The Acolyte:\n\n* Anakin's immaculate conception is supposed to be special, but The Acolyte is playing it down like it's no big deal and the witches are the ones that birthed Anakin.  Anakin was created by the force because it sensed a major imbalance.  This usually happens once every generation or so, but the kids are not always discovered.  Since Sith are the ones that like to dominate the force, they are usually the ones that cause these imbalances.  The Jedi tend to live in harmony with the force.\n* But where a LOT of fans (like me) are pissed off with The Acolyte is that they are stealing the story of Knights of the Old Republic.  This is something that fans have desperately wanted for decades.  The premise of KOTOR is that a Sith, called Darth Revan, gets captured by Jedi and they use the force to erase his memories and then they use him as a Jedi.  Eventually Darth Revan figures out what is done to him and that he's actually evil.  It's a really really awesome story.  Many of us strongly believe that this is the direction that Disney is going with The Acolyte.  If this is true, then Disney is essentially pulling the rug out from under our feet and taking this amazing story from us.",

It's upper there with White Lotus, The Bear, and HotD for me.\n- HotD S2- 9/10 A good foundation for everything- I'm not a fan of solely build to a war type seasons, but I like that the show in general takes a more nuanced approach to good vs evil and really digs into realistic motivation and redemption choices.\n- How I Met Your Mother- 8/10 I've watched random episodes, but going from the beginning is interesting & I'm invested\n- House of Cards- 9.5/10 For me it's a rewatch, and I'm finding it even better than the first time. I never finished it past season 4 so I'm excited to get some closure. Season 2 is slow af though this time through.\n\nFun-\n- Top Chef- 8.5/10 Finally get a WI season and it's been a weird one. I'm happy with the three going into the final- can't wait to watch the finale tomorrow. \n- Love Island USA- 9/10 This season is wild and filling my void of no Survivor in summer & Top Chef coming to an end.\n- Geek Girl- 8.5/10 Easy to watch, funny, and endearing\n- Gordon Ramsey's Food Stars- 7/10 Last season was horrible, and this season isn't a ton better.

I thought there struggles were realistic and the show handled there being drama there well without either character showing a lack of respect for the other or there ever being a moment where it looked like they would break up (I am sick of the will they/won't they in shows).!<\n\n>!The new characters introduced was a nice take but honestly I found Charlie to be obnoxious for the first half of the season. She was constantly causing issues by interrupting during medical emergencies and would refuse to listen to any criticism. Then suddenly halfway through the season it felt like she had a bit of a turnaround and everything was reconciled in a single episode then it was fine after that.!<\n\n>!Glassman taking in a drug addict drove me nuts and felt avoidable. By the end of the season I came around though and understood that it is more about him wanting to do something good and try to make amends for what happened to his daughter.!<\n\n>!Honestly I got the impression that the writers were told this was the final season halfway or 2/3 through the season because it felt like the season was setting up a lot of plotlines then quickly ramped up to wrapping up plotlines and resolving things right in the last few episodes.!<\n\n>!I thought the series finale was well done. I liked the time jump with Sean. Funny enough I think he committed a HIPA violation in his TED talk though by showing the names of every patient he has treated (unless he reached out to and got approval from every single one which I doubt).!<\n\nAnyway, good season and good show. Not always perfect but I think the drama about autism's representation in the series is overblown. Yes it doesn't represent all autistic people but no show could.

            "body": "***Doctor Who*** - Ncuti Gatwa continues his crying streak, probably marking him as, at best, the most outwardly distraught, and at worst the most hysterical, version of the Doctor we've ever seen. Last week's episode was a parody of *Bridgerton*, which I had not heard of before because I don't watch British aristocratic dramas, but I've absorbed enough information from pop culture osmosis to know about *Downton Abbey* and such, so I can appreciate the effort they put into the episode.\n\n Gay people aren't new to *Doctor Who*, even if the Internet culture war is trying to tell you that; Captain Jack was super bisexual, the Doctor had his moments, there were lesbians, etc. I was not a fan of the main villains though, because it reminded me of the Agatha Christie episode with the giant alien bee, but that's a personal gripe because I was far more interesting in episodes like *The Impossible Planet* or *Midnight* with more \"cerebral\" villains.\n\n***The Acolyte*** - As the most diehard *Star Wars* fan on the planet, the first thing I can say about this show is that it is very intriguing; it feels very similar to *Andor* in that I was apprehensive about it, but as the episodes came out and the picture began to solidify, I can really appreciate a bit of the slow burn mystery surrounding Osha and Mae, and what the Jedi did 16 years ago. The entire production is very well made, you can definitely tell they were smart with their money because the sets are great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, etc; the only technical flaw I can think of is >!Torbin's horrible fake beard!< in Episode 2, but that's par for the course with fake beards in *Star Wars* lmao. On the whole everyone is trying really hard and putting in the effort here and it shows.\n\nI must say that as the biggest SW fan ever, I have to concede that others might not be interested in this show for whatever reason; I like this show because it's finally showing, in a good and proper way, the politics and follies of the Jedi Order and how they fell from grace by the time of the Prequels, which of course led to their own destruction. These Jedi are obviously flawed, but they're not as robotic and callous like they were in the Prequels, *but you can see the inklings of that developing*. The mystery that underpins the whole plot is directly and thematically tied to this idea, **but if you don't care about that you probably won't care about this show**.\n\nA bunch of ragebait culture war vids on Youtube say that Episode 3 has destroyed the Force or something, and that's just because >!two lesbian witches had twins using the Force to do IVF or something!<, which isn't new information in the lore because that's how some of the Nightsisters made kids, and other Force-Sensitive sects do exist in the galaxy. **People wanted to hate this show the minute it was announced**, and so unfortunately any criticisms I see tend to be entirely subjective and most of the time downright sexist/bigoted/hateful in general, just because the main characters are female PoC, as well as the director/creator being a woman too. People are also now complaining about there being fire in space, which has always been there in *Star Wars*; if you're looking at this show and **nitpicking everything that you never did with other parts of the franchise**, ***are you being critical or are you being biased against it?***\n\nI'll try to provide some objective criticism here: I think that the show is relying heavily on a few tropes that maybe have gone out of fashion for a reason. The idea of a >!good and evil twin!< is tired. I also think that this show will probably benefit from rewatching, since the mystery and flashbacks still have to unfold, so these early episodes at this point are filled with questions, character decisions, and dialogue that may or may not be payoffs in the end, and we don't have all the information yet, so sometimes these decisions seem overly contrived for the story.",

Too many scenes in staid, airless rooms gives it a bit of a claustrophobic feel when Season 1 felt like an expansive playground for romance, even though the writing has never been that great. The primary emotions of the characters this season are anxiety and/or resentment, and it just isn't a fun romp any more. Nicola is doing a good job, but I'm likely going to tap out before the last ep. Also, the Viscount's wife's younger sister just seems to have disappeared.\n\nFinally checked out **Normal People,** and am halfway through. Very well directed. Totally get the raves for Mescal's understated approach to his character.\n\n**The Ultimatum (France and South Africa)** - Surprisingly good. I think some of the younger couples in entertainment fields were plants, though. Nkateko should have been smarter...\n\nWatched a lot of the French Open, but couldn't be bothered to hatewatch more than a few minutes of the NBA Finals because of the last two teams involved.

I know being cool, calm and collected is part of the gag in what most would consider a very intense and daunting job role, but most actors even over-act coolness and casualness. I've never seen two actors so good at reacting like actual humans. It's what's kept me watching past the first 10 min.\n\nSeriously, if Hollywood wasn't so ageist and sexist, we'd have seen more competent actors in shows and films. Instead, female leads are decided based on age and looks rather than talent. While male leads are cast based on who is in the director's in-club (Scorsese and Tarantino's Di Caprio, Pitt, Damon, Affleck alongside Robbie, and whoever's the latest 22-year-old bombshell). Not saying they're not talented \u2014 they're all very talented \u2014 but it means other actors who were the actual best fit for a role never got a chance.\n\nWhich is why it's so shocking to see the right actors cast for their role for a change. I.e., Mr and Mrs Smith. I.e., Dumb Money.\n\nPisses me off for all the worthy actors who didn't get a chance in previous eras because they were women over 30 (or realistically, over 25) or because they weren't white. Glad it's (slowly) changing. Looking forward to seeing the calibre of film and television content improve as a direct result of this and more women in the director's chair.",
