            "body": "I finished **Barry Season 4.** I still have kind of mixed feelings on the season. I still feel like it was at it's best in the earlier seasons when it was a bit more comedic. But what Hader has done with the last season is certainly impressive, clever, dramatic, and an interesting study of the characters. I didn't find myself watching it religiously every week as I used to, I watched the first couple of episodes when they came out, thought \"this is a bit too dark now, I need to be in the right mood to watch more\" and didn't catch up again til near the end. \n\nI love a good black comedy and I applaud what they did in bending the genres, but admittedly I got less enjoyment out of this season than I did the previous ones. I did think the final episode was a satisfying and deserved conclusion for most of the characters.\n\nAlso finished **Ted Lasso Season 3.** It was still a lot of fun, got plenty of laughs out of me, and it was nice to see a (mostly) satisfying ending for (most of) the characters. I'm still not sure that the move to longer episodes was a good idea. While it was nice to see some time spent with other characters, instead of the extra time allowing them to give more time to each of these stories, it just felt like they had twice as many stories that didn't get quite as much depth as they needed. Keeley's plots seemed entirely superfluous to the story, Nate didn't feel like he got enough development to earn his inevitable redemption arc, some of the \"topical\" stories like Sam's restaurant and politics, Keeley's leaks, and the super league felt kind of forced references to real world events. It left on a bit of a melancholy note with Ted doing the \"right\" thing but not really seeming happy about it. \n\nPresumably they're leaving some things open ended for either more seasons or a spin off, but it left it in a kind of odd place where it felt like they were rushing to tie up a few plot points, but also going out of their way not to give proper closure on others. Overall, I did still enjoy the season a lot, there were lots of funny, heartwarming, and tearjerking moments, but it felt like it didn't quite live up to it's potential.\n\nI started **Silo** this week too, just 3 episodes in so far. Really interesting so far, and I do have a soft spot for these sorts of post-apocalyptic stories. I have no idea where it's going really, which is both exciting and also slightly concerning, since some of these vague mystery shows do tend to collapse under their own intrigue at some point. I'm encouraged by this being based on a complete book series that's well received though, so there should be less issues compared to some other shows that don't know how to wrap things up.\n\nAlso, not sure if anime counts here, but since it's on Netflix, a brief mention to **Vinland Saga Season 2** which I churned through this week. with just a couple of episodes left. It's an interesting contrast to S1, where my main takeaways were \"the viking lore and fighting is really cool, but I kind of hate the main character\". In S2, the viking lore remains interesting, there's very little fighting, and the main character hates himself too. It's an effective tale of redemption, some interesting philosophical bits on war, peace, and whether people can change. People sure do scream and cry a lot on this show though.",

I can see why it's highly acclaimed and recommend.\n\n**The Idol** is such a let down, some scenes felt like it came out from a porn. Nope, hard pass. What a waste. To wonder they did a soft reboot of the show when it was almost completed, basically altering the plotline or whatnot. HBO really fumbled on this one.

Just a great prestige drama about two rivals battling it out to inherit a $150 million wine collection! Sounds dull but this ended up being a captivating watch. I\u2019ve heard folks compare this one with Succession but it is a completely different type of show. The only thing they truly have in common is that they are top quality shows as tonally they are very different styles of shows. \n\n**Muted** - This was compelling soapy trash but, yeash, was the writing awful! I quite liked elements of the story but other bits were unbelievably dumb and that ending episode was absolutely awful! \n\n**See s3** - I\u2019m late to getting to this final season of the show and it took me a while to get back into the story. I did eventually get sucked back in and thought the season was OK. The ending was a mixed bag. I quite liked how it ended for a lot of characters. Unfortunately the ending just confirmed that Kofun was an absolute idiot. The kid was the worst from the start and he just did not get any less dumb or annoying as the series progressed so obviously he had to wrap in the dumbest possible fashion! I\u2019ll remember See as a fun but deeply flawed fantasy/action show. It had great production values and the action was always great\u2026everything else was a bit hit and miss. \n\nNext up for me is **Joe Pickett**. The first season has finally landed in my region!

Season 2 has been decent so far, but really not a fan of Duncan. \n\nThe other two: so funny but man are they digging Carey into a hole. latest episode definitely reminded me of \u201cthe rehearsal\u201d lol. \n\nArrested development: gf\u2019s never seen it and we\u2019re just a few eps in. Been about a decade since I\u2019ve seen it but it holds up!! Utterly hilarious, will probably jump ship after s3 (unless someone can convince me otherwise) \n\nPlatonic: probably my favorite show rn, I just have a soft spot for easy going, stupid but smartly written comedies. The latest episode might have been my favorite. \n\nMasterchef: worst produced show I\u2019ll watch continuously, i nearly watch it as a comedy with how cliched and dramatic the editing/music it is \n\nI think I\u2019ll start drops of god soon, seems like my type of show",

Really enjoyable drama about wine-making and wine-tasting where you don\u2019t have to know anything about wine or even drink it to\nenjoy the story.  I personally only like to look at the wine labels.  The show is about an odd inheritance contest between two young people, each gifted in different ways, one with formal education and another with a natural advantage playing catch-up to compensate for lost time.  Really enjoyable and each episode feels long and eventful.",

            "body": "Over the past 5 days I have watched these shows:\n\n1. **Yellowjackets S1, S2**\n\nI've had this on my list for ages and I finally got around to watching it - right when S2 ended. I binged both back to back, and thought that this was an excellent show. \n\nThe writing was amazing, the twists and payoffs well worth the watch, and above everything else, the CAST. The younger characters and their older counterparts are so absolutely perfectly cast, I don't think there's a comparison current or past for how good it is.\n\n(A small note here about the younger actresses - all of them are exceptional. It might seem like hyperbole, and probably is, but these might be the most realistic teenagers on television, especially considering we live in a world post-Euphoria and Riverdale. All of these actresses, I have no doubt, are going to go on to do amazing things in TV and film and I can't wait to see their future works.) \n\nIt touches comedy, drama, mystery, thriller, horror genres, and whatever it does, it does brilliantly. The same episode will contain moments that make you laugh out loud AND have one of the most horrific / excruciatingly sad depictions of depravity and trauma.\n\nIf you've been on the fence about this - don't be. I can't wait to see what comes next, and Melanie Lynskey is a very strong contender for Lead Actress after having watched this (although there will most definitely be a Succession sweep this year). There could have been a few improvements in S2 especially towards the end, but seeing the calibre of writing for both seasons I have no doubt these kinks would be ironed out. \n\nAlso - Christina Ricci's character has immediately become an all-time-great for me. Absolutely hilarious and one of the best things about the show. \n\n\n2. **The Great S3**\n\nOf all the young actors working today, I've always wondered how Elle Fanning has been overlooked. I've been following this show from it's first season, and I think if all the categories weren't absolutely stacked this year, Elle Fanning 100% deserves an award for her performance in this. Nicholas Hoult is always great, and unlike the show's subreddit, I was actually fine with some of the plotlines and themes this season. It's as funny as ever, and somehow seems more mature than earlier seasons. Great stuff.\n\n\n3. **Fleishman Is In trouble (Miniseries)**\n\nClaire Danes being one of the actors in the Variety interviews prompted me to Google her recent performances (why else would she be front and center in an actors on actors lineup). The last thing I remembered seeing her in was Homeland.\n\nThis is a miniseries about a couple going through divorce. Your mind could go to 'Scenes From A Marriage' upon hearing this, but this is different. This is simultaneously much lighter and somehow more brutal. \n\nWithout any spoilers, one of the episodes near the end had me crying, the grief, the trauma, the need to be needed by someone. I'm at the lowest point in my life and I could relate to this episode the most and see parallels with my own life.\n\nIf you don't like the first few episodes, keep going because it is all worth it in the end. I thought I wouldn't like Jesse Eisenberg's acting but it was good. Lizzy Caplan was unexpectedly great in this. The script is great - there are a lot of lines sprinkled in there that you could miss at first glance but I found myself rewinding and listening to them again and again.\n\n\n4. **Never Have I Ever S4 (Final Season)** \n\nThis show has never been award worthy, acting or script wise, but it has a soft spot in my heart because it is a teen show with a fresh perspective on the classic coming of age formula, although there are tons of tropes you could spot if you're nitpicky about it. The music choices are always great on this show and all four seasons have given me songs that I never would've discovered otherwise.\n\nThe final season is a good conclusion to the story. Again, the subreddit for this show was weird about 'character ships,' and 'endgame', but to me this was Devi's story through and through. Despite some odd choices and side plots that could have been cut entirely without affecting the outcome, Never Have I Ever was the same heartfelt, breezy summer casual binge it always was to me. I finished it last night and I'm satisfied with how it ended.\n\n\nEdit: to add White House Plumbers, which I just finished\n\n5. **White House Plumbers (Miniseries)**\n\nWhite House Plumbers is about the Watergate scandal. It's a taut 5 episode miniseries that is a satire / farce, which is something you should keep in mind to keep your expectations in check. Justin Theroux is unbelievably great in this and I'm constantly disappointed how and why his agent doesn't get him roles that would make him a much bigger name than he is. I'd be content with more character driver work from him if there were more (and god there needs to be more of JT on screen). \n\nAs someone who knew very little about the details of the scandal, this was a pretty good watch. 5 episodes sounded too little to me but they told a story and it was over, which is refreshing even for a miniseries.",

Perfect for a 90s teen in a horror show.\n\nAnd I've always been a Christina Ricci fan (was disappointed in how little she had to do in Wednesday but that was for the obvious reason) and Misty fucking Quigley is the most fun character I've seen in a TV show in awhile.

I get being upset with the API thing.  If my old Alien Blue stops working I won't be using Reddit on mobile at all.  However the mods also don't own that community.  I'm not sure if they had a public vote on it, but even if they did, it was during a lull between ST seasons where the subreddit was pretty quiet (compared to, say, today when a new season of SNW is out).  I defended the /r/startrek mods in their heavy moderating of all nuTrek stuff, but this seems like they're making a big decision on behalf of a lot of people without really consulting them, basically killing a community on Reddit.  If they want to make their own site thats cool, but not wanting to run a subreddit anymore shouldn't mean that you get to burn it down.",

Slow burn isn't a strong enough word for it. Just bafflingly slow. There are whole episodes where *nothing* happens. Literally nothing. Or where the only thing that happens is that somebody who Phillip has been socially engineering starts to break out of his spell for a few minutes, but then he turns things around and gets them back under his control, and ultimately things end up *exactly* where they started at the beginning of the episode (ie no net change).\n\nDon't get me wrong. It's brilliant. Not sure I would change a thing about it.\n\nBut I can't watch 70 hours of mostly atmosphere all over again. I've tried. Multiple times. I think I made it five or six episodes into a rewatch. And the first season is much more quickly paced than most of the middle seasons too!\n\nAnyway. My two cents is to stick with it. The final season is soooo good and sooo worth it to me.",

The first 3 episodes focus on wildlife, not intelligent aliens. There\u2019s a mix of computer generated stuff with the hypothetical aliens and real life stuff about Earth and how life evolved here to explain the logic behind the hypothetical stuff. The graphics of the computer stuff is good and the narrator is good to listen to. The real life stuff is sort of interesting.

The show has an incredibly dark subject matter but isn't scary or dark itself, and instead is a more mystery show with engaging characters. The cast is great and, often, funny, but the mystery element is both drawn out and shockingly underdeveloped. In the latter sense, I mean we are talking about 2-5 minutes of dialogue worth of development for centuries troden tropes. Instead there are clues and hints, and little mysteries that didn't really interest me because they were tied to the show in high school level way (they broken so let's break something. metaphor!).\n\nBut the actors are incredible, absolutely incredible and the characters, while nonsensical and again, sometimes unbelievable are watchable. I found this part of the show worthwhile but certainly it did not need to take 4 seasons and the length undermined it. To that end season 2 is the height of the fake mystery, drawn out dialogue, bad pacing.\n\nIt's not a show I can recommend but it was a good show overall I'd give it around a 7.\n\nAlso, starting watching Ted Lasso and it's sort of a bore so far.",

It\u2019s a really well done first person account via musicians, producers, and other various VIPs (audio only\u2026.everything else is footage) directly or indirectly related to the early 70s music scene. In essence, the series aims to hold a\na magnifying glass up to how a single year\u2019s music intersected with society, morality, and politics. \n\nBefore I started watching it I always felt like 1968/69 was *the pinnacle year* of music, where an insane amount of top quality records came out. But it turns out I hadn\u2019t given \u201871 enough credit.  \u201871 coincided with a well-defined and dramatic shift immediately following the late 60s era of all things flower power/free love/hippie/psychedelia/revolution and this does a fine job at connecting all of these moving parts into an enjoyable and easy watchin\u2019 retrospective. \n\n[From a NYT review when it first came out in 2021:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/arts/television/1971-year-music-changed-everything.html)\n\n>>\u2026.Did the music of 1971 really change things more than \u201972? What would 1969 have to say about it? How to begin even making the case?\n\n>>Sometimes you\u2019ve got to make a bold statement,\u201d said Asif Kapadia, the series\u2019s overall director and one of its executive producers, in a video call from London. \u201cFrom our research, there was something amazing about that particular moment, where it comes after the \u201960s, where it comes in terms of the \u201970s, as a turning point.\n\n\nThe Stones are featured *heavily* throughout the doc as is Bowie but there\u2019s also some very well-researched episodes covering Sly and the Family Stone, Tina Turner, Gil Scott-Heron, Joanie Mitchell, Carole King, and Bill Withers all behind the backdrop of Gonzo journalism (Hunter S Thompson), Black Power (the Panthers, Angela Davis), The Weather Underground, glam rock (Marc Bolan et al), Vietnam, and a shit ton of cocaine.",

Also Tom Holland can\u2019t seem to pick a good role outside of Spider-Man can he? Cherry, Uncharted and now this.\n\nAlso finally checked out Yellowjackets all the actresses are extremely good here but unfortunately I feel like Season 2 took a nosedive in quality and I\u2019m not really compelled to see Season 3 at this point.

Raff also co-created *Tyrant* (along (FX/Hulu) and created/directed Netflix's *The Spy.*\n\nI also very much liked the South African series, [*Trackers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwsH1_jfgnw)*,* which is on Cinemax but never got pulled into the ~~HBO~~ Max lifeboat.\n\nYou could also give [*The Capture*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-D2I5tE898) (Peacock/BBC) a try. I also loved [*Black Earth Rising*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugxQuVPmVZU) (Netflix), but that's more in the political thriller arena than espionage/action.\n\nThere are also the two AMC/BBC LeCarr\u00e9 adaptations: [*The Night Manager*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfzzLqzEf-I) (on Amazon Prime right now; Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Debicki, and a bazillion other familiar faces) and [*The Little Drummer Girl*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GZZ0oXsuQQ) (AMC+; Florence Pugh, Alexander Skarsgard)*.*\n\nLastly, if it's not the Gideon Raff bits of *Homeland* you liked, but rather the *24*\\-ish bits that were done by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, those two showrunners (along with *House MD* showrunner, David Shore) currently have a Fox/Hulu show, [*Accused*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPlWCp-kRM), which is a crime non-procedural :) based on the older BBC series by *Cracker's* Jimmy McGovern.

I thought it was going to be a reality show similar to Sweet Life (which I loved and want more of) but it's a soundstage sitcom with very wooden acting and terrible scripting. Noped out almost immediately. \n\n**Season 2 of Prehistoric Planet** Apple TV. David Attenborough is just so precious and fairly vibrating with enthusiasm for the dinos I love it. I find myself thinking about how exciting it must have been for the artists to do the fun stuff like the faux \"thermal camera\" or night vision camera scenes, but that doesn't take away from the awe inspiring work of the artists. \n\n**Shiny Happy People** on Prime. Oof, for those that lived through religious trauma, it's tough going. But it tears the roof off the disgusting and harmful practices and ideas of fundamentalism. \n\n**Fatal Attraction remake** on Prime. Actually decent? I feel that the female lead for Alex is miscast, which is a shame because Joshua Jackson is perfectly cast. I really like the foreshadowing of Dan's entitlement and recklessness in episode 1 when he gets into a wreck after driving drunk and walks away, having a friend help him clean it up and cover it up. I'm iffy on having him be a judge but I get that it ups the stakes in terms of how his life could be ruined. In the 80's it was enough that just being unfaithful could blow up your life.

The actress is great and the guy is a famous comedian/actor, but the show is pretty obscure.\n\nI love Aussie culture, having visited Melbourne when I was younger.  Plus, I've followed Tim Minchin's career for two decades, so I'd suggest you look up Tim Minchin and decide if you like his style of comedy.\n\nI also enjoyed The Queen's Gambit and Ozark, both of which I watched with my mid-70s parents and cringed at all the sex references and bad language (I grew up in the 80s and 90s, but my parents had to ask me what a few things meant, which was pretty awkward).\n\nI sort of lost interest in TV when the pandemic hit, and I was weeks away from graduating from college when the 1998 writers' strike happened (ruining almost every show I liked other than the Simpsons), but even though some of the great late 90s shows haven't come back (I'm looking at you, \"Pushing Daisies\"), a lot of franchises have made comebacks since the pandemic.  \n\nBut I'm so glad that Tim Minchin has been so successful.

Now I've made eight episodes). For *me* currently it's 7*/10.*\n\n I wouldn't exactly call it eye candy overall , I'm not a sucker for the music and I'm not sure there's even been one scene that will stick in my memory for years. There's frankly rather little character development and a lack of substantial psychology going on. Complex power dynamics, tension, funny moments, \"Say my name\" moments, great writing, super acting like in Breaking Bad? Not so much I guess. Yeah, I don't get it, really. BB, BCS, Mindhunter, Fargo, Succession, Gomorrha, Fauda, Barry, True Detective, and I could easily come up with ten more shows I find much superior.",
