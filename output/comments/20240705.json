            "body": "After a few weeks of not watching many TV shows I\u2019ve binged through a bunch of them in the last week or so. Luckily most of them were pretty good! \n\n**Douglas is Cancelled** - I was a little worried this might be one of those anti-consequence messaging shows so was wary going into it but decided to give it a chance after the trailer made it seem intriguing. I\u2019m glad I took a chance on this one as it was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the better ITV offerings I\u2019ve seen in years. The show nailed the balance between comedy and drama and was very satisfying despite hinting at some dark subject matter. The main cast was very good particularly the two leads Karen Gillan and Hugh Bonneville. I also liked the pacing of the show and how the plot developed in an unexpected but enthralling way. It was only 4 episodes long but that seemed the perfect amount of time needed to tell this story. \n\n**Sugar** - This was OK. A modern day LA detective noir with a weird scifi twist. Collin Farrell had a good outing as John Sugar but the plot was never all that exciting. If they make more I\u2019ll watch more but I did not love it as much as a lot of others have. Reminds me of Under the Silver Lake with its artsy style! \n\n**Blue Ridge** - Meh\u2026this was a passable old school weekly crime show. Reminded me a bit of a modern day Walker Texas Ranger but with a bit more of a rural setting. Watchable but definitely a tad forgettable. \n\n**Under the Bridge** - I really enjoyed this true crime drama. It told the story tale of the murder of high schooler Reena Virk and the following investigation to catch the killers. It was a compelling tale and all the more horrifying for being based on true events. Both Riley Keogh and Lily Gladstone were as good as expected from such great actresses but I think the young cast also deserve a lot of credit as they were fantastic in their roles. A real mix of naive, vulnerable, cruel, and charismatic in equal turns. Excellent crime show. \n\n**Clipped** - This was another excellent drama based on true events. This time chronicling the downfall of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after a racist video came to light. It was a fascinating story that I was completely unaware of being neither American or a basketball fan. The show mixed drama and comedy well and had fantastic performances from most of the cast. Crazy story but a real fun TV show! \n\n**The Veil** - I enjoyed this spy drama. It was not quite on the level of The Old Man but it was watchable and pretty good despite some improbable moments. The leads, Elisabeth Moss and Yumna Marwan, were excellent in their roles while I felt like Josh Charles had some scene stealing moments as an obnoxious CIA agent with a penchant for rubbing folks the wrong way. It was not a perfect show and I was not super keen on the ending but on the whole this limited series still gets a big thumbs up from me. \n\nI know The Bear and Shogun have gotten all the attention this year from FX/Hulu but absolutely do not sleep on Under the Bridge, Clipped, or The Veil as they are very good shows in their own right! FX/Hulu are very quietly having a very strong 2024 so far! \n\nNext up I\u2019m thinking about **Trying s4** and possibly **We Were the Lucky Ones**. The latter seems a pretty depressing story but I\u2019m on a roll with FX/Hulu so I\u2019m just going to go ahead and give it a go as I\u2019ve not been let down so far in 2024 by the network.",

Yes, there are things that are obviously targeted at children but if you're a fan of Trek, even if you're a scifi fan who has never watched Trek, you will enjoy this show.

Not to mention, our second billed lead actor... for the first two episodes, and leading names, that\u2019s even on one of the damn posters, is basically sidelined into a minor side character in the back half of the show.\n\nThe way it handles its themes and subjects of right wing extremism is *extremely* in your face and on the nose.

            "body": "**America's Sweethearts** on Netflix I am very into behind the scenes shows specifically about sports as I have the hand-eye coordination and spatial reasoning of an undifferentiated clump of cells, so I find them fascinating. I actually have Deep ThoughtsTM about the reaction online to the older women who are running the show: the two coaches and managers and Charlotte Jones. I recently saw a TT where someone was excoriating them as horrible, awful, mean, terrible, but the only concrete example was the insistence that they be called \"ma'am.\" I dunno, I think this is sexism and internalized misogyny with a sprinkle of ageism, frankly. I didn't see these older women cursing, insulting, or otherwise treating these younger women with anything but stern respect and having very high standards. I strongly (strongly) suspect if these were men, we would have nothing to say except that they were \"geniuses\" like Steve Jobs types. They are exacting and focused Type A people, so what. One of them (Kelly I believe) is directly responsible for growing the DCC into a multi million dollar org. I don't want to hear what a \"bitch\" she is. She's a hard nosed business-person, sure. But this take really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure it's up to Charlotte Jones per se to decide on the DCC salaries (the other area the TT-er was going on about) and it is a part time entertaiment job that 1000s of women want. I can imagine it's very difficult to peg that market rate for that job. \nAlso I really pity Victoria--my heart breaks for her. She's not the same kind of beautiful as the other women and clearly isn't the same personality type (ultra extroverted, bubbly, conventional/normal). Victoria the call is coming from in the house with that Grey Gardens set up you have with Mother Dearest. Blink twice girl! \n\n**Tell them you love me** on Netflix Holy CRAP. Where to start. I will say this: the documentary (like all of them) has a tendency to let their subjects go unchallenged. One example is when John the older brother gets \"freaked out\" by the main lady/perp saying that she would \"sign in blood\" to be with DMan--hello John, listen to the *whole message*. It says she would sign a contract that she would **get divorced** to be with \"Dman\". (which...still doesn't paint her in a great light, admittedly). This kind of basic mishearing and misunderstanding reduces the credibility of the subjects, and they 100% have a case! She assaulted him! She r_ped him! It's sickening. But what's most confusing to me is how a woman her age and with her intelligence could find a man who is so *clearly* mentally compromised and like half her height and weight attractive *physically*!!! I used to work with special needs college students, I was called the \"handicapped whisperer\" (these were less sensitive times) because I had a knack for understanding people with severe speech and cognition struggles. I had a student ask me what I wanted and promise to get my anything I wanted--his name was Rodney and he'd been shot in the head in a gang alteraction and had permanent brain damage. I told him \"you can get me the VHS tape of *L.A. Story* if you want, but nothing more expensive than that\" because he had the **mind of a child**!! (He did get it and I was very touched). He was technically an adult but there was like...ZERO chance I would let him think I was interested, etc. \n\n**Vanderpump Rules** last episode of Season 11, reunion. I mean, LaLa has a point, but she is so aggressive and unable to articulate it and so self-serving that it gets lost in the bickering. I feel for Jo--Jesus CHRIST woman have some dignity. Yes, it's startling just how beautiful Tom Schwartz was at one point--he probably could have been a celebrity if he had laid off the drugs and drinking, but GIRL. It's L.A. There's 10 million of them out there. And he's nowhere near the looks he had! \n\n\nMovies: \n\n**The Swimmer** (1968, Burt Lancaster) this is free on Prime! WOW. This should have been a classic. It gets a little corny at times, like the last shot 100% should have been the interior of the house looking like a painting (knocked me out with how stunning that was) not drenchola Burt crying and ineffectually banging at the door, and some of the editing was...not great. But this is so, so, so good. If you like Mad Men, this is a must watch. Also, how tall *is* Burt? Like 6'5\"? He seems really, really tall.\n\n**Arrival** okay I may get flamed for this but I found this very cheesy and treacley. Am I just a cold hard battleax of a person? Firstly, I HATE how almost every sci-fi story with a woman is about her motherhood. ENOUGH. The scene where Noomi Rapace cuts the alien out of her body in the machine that's made only for men in Prometheus is burned into my memory it was so amazing and unique because of this. Secondly, it just felt obvious and heart-tugging, like it was 100% clear to me that the sequence at the beginning was not in the past! I also felt like the term \"po-faced\" really applied here. Like everything was very...Mary Sue? Something? People help me out here, were you a sobbing mess at the soaring instrumental very obviously designed to destroy you or were you like \"why is the achievement/most important thing of her life her CHILD AUGUGHGH?!?!!?\" \n\n**The Lodge** I'm on a horror kick lately and this was...okay. If the movie had been able to maintain the shocker of the first 10 minutes (holy COW Alicia Silverstone does so much with so little) it would have been great. But it was like a 6/10 for me. Also wow, F them kids. \n\n**Midsommer** Okay, again I'm showing my weird side but I found this beautiful and the ending almost uplifting? Then again I thought Aniara was a weirdly happy/gorgeous/hopeful ending when others said it left them in the pit of despair for days. So clearly I'm not a reliable narrator here. \n\n**Hereditary** 10/10 but I also watched the Novum Hereditary explainer that's like 4 hours long prior to it and that made the experience so much better. I imagine this would have been **terrifying** in theatres.",
