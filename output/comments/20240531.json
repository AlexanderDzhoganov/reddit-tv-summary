What it is is a reasonbly light whodunnit type murder mystery taking in place in Ireland. At only 7 episodes long the story pace is pretty quick doesnt & doesnt drag in minutia much.  Theres minimal character development with the three main characters, seems like they have set themselves up for another season though to dig deeper into each of them.

It's an interesting story so far (I've not read the books) but the characters are sometimes a bit weak/shallow, and the visuals sometimes ropey.  Definitely only one for 'weird' scifi fans.  Personally, I enjoyed it and will watch season 2.\n\nFallout - I enjoyed this one, but it might be one for fans of the games.  It's a fun romp through a very stylized world.  Don't expect Shakespeare - it's pure entertainment.\n\nLOTR - distinctly average.  A bit plodding and dull at times.  Has some good moments, and I'll probably watch season 2 in the hopes they learn from their mistakes, but I can't recommend it on season 1 alone.\n\nMindhunter - man is this show divisive.  I loved it, but I've met so many people that describe it as utter crap.  It is a very slow burn show, and I think some people go in thinking it's a murder mystery type show. It's so very much not that. It's 50% talking to killers and 50% talking about how they can use those talks to catch other killers.  I found it fascinating, but I can totally see why many people hate it.",

                    "body": "Shogun is excellent, totally captivating and superbly made. Deep characters whose motivations and plans are slowly revealed throughout the series, amazing cinematography that tells a story in itself. I've not read the book but opinion on the adaptation seems to be mostly positive from book readers, which is rare. Having an interest in Japanese culture/history might help, there's some inevitable Game of Thrones comparisons that can be made about any story with warring factions, but it's almost entirely about the behind the scenes politics and scheming. Highly recommend to anyone that's ok with lots of subtitles.\n\n3 Body Problem was good, really interesting concepts and generally does a good job of explaining things well despite some weird sci-fi and science. Pacing is a bit inconsistent, characters aren't the most exciting, but it's more about the mystery and science (the books they're based on apparently have even fewer characters who mostly serve as plot exposition, which says something about the focus of the story). Recommend for sci-fi fans and those ok with a slow burn, a more scientific style of sci-fi, and not expecting action.\n\nFallout was great, as someone who had tried the games briefly but never really gotten into them. The show did a great job of portraying a complex world with many factions in 10 episodes, which you'd need far more hours in the games to piece it all together. It's got an overarching story but the focus is more on the individual places and encounters they encounter each episode. It takes a little while to get into it's groove, but I love the whole retro futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. Recommend for anyone that wants some good (and violent) fun in a cool world, regardless of if you've played these (or any) video games.\n\nRings of Power was fine, if a little forgettable. As someone who was never all that into Lord of the Rings I probably had lower expectations than most, and it exceeded them. So I can't speak to accuracy or how it lives up to the series, but it's a fun fantasy adventure with enough characters and threads to keep it interesting. I'm struggling to remember any particular standout moments from it, but I don't have a lot of holes to pick in it either, and enjoyed the journey. Mildly recommend to anyone who enjoys a fantasy adventure, if you don't set your expectations based on the LotR movies or books.\n\nNot seen Mindhunter. Based on all the other comments here with similar opinions on the others, I should probably watch it.",

Something about that character didn't land.  Might not have been the actor, might have been the up-jumped dandy archetype just not being explained enough.  Lots of opportunistic types got positions of power in Tudor times and results varied.  Shardlake himself probably would have been discriminated against in the previous power structure.  How close everyone is to being head lopped or put on the rack was true for the times but felt dropped in at the end.  I don't think our storytelling structures are designed to handle this much ambiguity and hearing them creak might be a good thing?",

SO GOOD and again, the show is better for it when they\u2019re the focus. I read Rebecca Godfrey\u2019s book this week and I have to say, I liked it so much more because of that - no shoehorned in adult storylines. I didn\u2019t realize Cam was a fictional character for the show but it makes so much more sense to me that she is with how half-baked her storyline was. I overall liked the show, the performances were great (my general distaste for Cam and Rebecca storylines has nothing to do with Lily Gladstone or Riley Keough - they were both great and did the best they could with the material they were given), and there were so many beautifully done scenes - and some great needle drops.\n- someone cast Chloe Guidry (Josephine) in that Dark Places series reboot that Gillian Flynn is doing. She would be an AMAZING Diondra.\n\n**Hacks:** one of my Facebook memories today, oddly enough, was a post from 2021 where I said \u201csomeone get Jean Smart an Emmy PLEASE (for Hacks or Mare of Easttown, she was amazing in both)\u201d. Now in 2024, I again am rooting for Jean Smart, but I am also rooting hard for both Hannah Einbinder and Paul W. Downs, both of whom had series-best performances this week. I\u2019ve long been a fan of Downs (Trey was one of my favorite characters of Broad City!) and his scene on the plane had me doubled over laughing. What a finale. I think the 3rd season of Hacks may be my personal favorite.\n- Also, KAITLIN OLSON. She may not have been in the season much, but she absolutely used the screentime she had.

I saw the review saying it's leaning more towards dramedy this season. I'm not sure I totally agree just because it's delving into the other characters a bit more. Strongly recommend watching if you haven't seen it.\n\n**My Adventures with Superman** - Loving the second season. The stuff they're doing with Lois's father is a lot of  fun.\n\n**Manhunt** - Just finished it. It was enjoyable and it made me read up a lot on the history, I didn't realize it was an actual conspiracy to kill Lincoln. The last couple episodes aren't as good to be honest.",

I can't wait to see where it goes. \n\nMost of the stuff I've been watching as it airs has just ended their seasons, like Will Trent, Abbott Elementary (which are I think the only two broadcast network shows I watch at this point), The Sympathizer, and The Jinx. re on Will Trent is definitely one of the better network procedurals. I really enjoy procedurals for the most part, but I feel like most of the ones that are on network right now are just so flat and boring, like they're doing the bare minimum to fill the air time. Will Trent is a lot more interesting and has a lot of really great character work (though I will say I'm not crazy about how the season ended). And of course Abbott Elementary is great. It's so good to see that the traditional network sitcom can still be done well. I really loved The Sympathizer. I can't really put my finger on what I think makes it so special, but there's definitely something really creative in its tone and the way it tells its story. I enjoyed season 2 of The Jinx well enough, but I do feel like it maybe didn't need to be six episodes. There were definitely parts that felt really drawn out.\n\nI've started rewatching season 1 of For All Mankind so I can watch seasons 2 & 3. I was surprised by how little I actually remembered of it, especially because it is so good. I really enjoy alternate history, but it's really nice to see an alternate history show that isn't something like \"what if the Nazis won WWII\".\n\nI thought Fallout was fantastic. Really captured the tone and atmosphere of the game while telling a good story with some great characters. And I love Walton Goggins in anything.\n\nI'm still in the middle of Ripley on Netflix. Even though I know everything that happens in the story, it's still so anxiety inducing. But that's kind of a testament to how well made it is.",

            "body": "**Jurassic World: Chaos Theory**\n\nThis show does a great job evolving the characters' stories, and maturing with its characters.  Compared to Camp Cretaceous, where it kind of felt like a kids adventure gone wrong, this *does* keep a fair amount of the lighter aspects, but generally has a darker tone with a mystery/conspiracy edge to it.  And the dino action is actually really well done, and can be pretty tense a lot of the time.  It does take a while for them to get the group back together, but I didn't mind too much since it allowed them to build things up with each one.  I really hope this show does well, because its story really deserves to be continued IMO.\n\n**Fallout**\n\nI admittedly have limited knowledge of the games themselves, despite having a lot of them in my massive Steam backlog and playing a little bit of a few of them.  That being said, I really liked what they did with this show.  It's a very fun take on a post-apocalyptic world, with a good mix of light comedy and more plots, and does a good job portraying the morality struggle I do know is an important part of the games.  Ella Purnell and Walton Goggin were the stand-outs in the cast IMO (and I liked Michael Emerson's role as well), but a lot of the cast is good in their own way IMO.\n\n**Star Trek Discovery season 5**\n\nI know this isn't everyone's favorite, but I really liked this show and am sorry to see it go.  While I don't think I'd have this at the top of my season rankings, I thought they did a good job with it, and it felt surprisingly like a final season despite the fact that they were caught off guard with its cancellation.  It may have been a bit slow at times, with its kind of fetch-quest structure, but it also led to some interesting themes.  I don't think the season would win anyone over who don't feel drawn to the show, but for those of us who are, I'd say it's a pretty solid send-off.",

Instead, Sheldon becomes kind of an underdog/antihero in a matter of speaking. And this is also a facet of point 2, since only one character (in most scenes) is a part of nerd culture, they can't just have him drop buzzwords and references as punchlines since that wouldn't make any sense to other characters\n\n5. coming of age shows are fundamentally more interesting (and funny) than romance stories which TBBT also seemed to always boil down into\n\n6. mathematical and scientific ideas often factor into the plot in meaningful ways, eg in a personal favorite ep of mine in which Sheldon temporarily becomes convinced that \"zero\" might not be real. He goes to his mentors and advisors and they are also thrown into existential crisis by his most reasonable postulations. Try to imagine any other show having a full episode in which a basic concept of science/math/logic is interrogated! I don't perfectly love the resolution of that storyline, btw, but it ties into the next point\n\n7. the contrast between Sheldon's \"sheldon-ness\" (atheist \"scientism\") and his mother's faith (and his constant arguments with their priest) add kind of a fun angle to the show that is repeatedly explored\n\n8. the relationship between Sheldon and his father is very touching and very against-trope for effeminate boys like Sheldon being raised in religious, sports-loving households. In my opinion, it is the emotional center of the show.\n\nAll that said, YS is still a fairly broad, mainstream comedy that is far from a new favorite of mine or anything like that and the voiceover really holds it back for me (it sometimes wants to be The Wonder Years, but *nothing* is The Wonder Years), but it deserves credit where credit is due for improving on The Big Bang Theory in virtually every way.",

The journey the characters are going on, and the things they have to go through to get to it.\n\nI'm a sucker for world building and weird sci-fi I guess, and I've seen very few sci-fi worlds that are as elaborate, intriguing, and distinctly \\*alien\\* as this. It might be more exciting if there were more interesting characters and a grander story to it, but perhaps that might just get in the way of it.\n\nBut yeah, it's probably not for everyone, and if you're not into the show by episode 4, chances are it's not going to change your mind.
