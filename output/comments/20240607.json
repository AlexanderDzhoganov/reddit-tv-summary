Overall I found it one of the most enjoyable dramedy I've watched, said a lot about the show that I'm not even into stand-up comedy IRL.\n\n**Undone S2**: for most of it, I was thinking about how unnecessary this season was, on top of the main character really getting on my nerves. Changed my mind after the final two episodes lol, it made the entire thing worth it in retrospect and the ending was even better than the first season's. Great use of rotoscoping animation and psychological/(ambiguous) sci-fi element.

It's not going to blow your socks off with action, CGI, or any of the reality based nonsense we see a lot of tv shows have now.  Its just a great light hearted show that makes you fall in love with the characters and gets you lost in the world that Maximo (main character) paints for you back when he worked for a resort in the 1980's.  I highly recommend the show.  I would almost compare this to \"How I Met Your Mother\" but a different genre altogether.  I love the characters, the mini stories in the episodes are fun, and I'm heavily involved in the main present day story that is taking place.  This is the most underrated series going, and that is a hill I'll die on.   Check it out everyone!",

The idea of surviving on an alien planet can be an interesting one if done right, and it helps that they put so much thought into the planet itself.  The planet's ecosystem feels so alive, and so... alien, and I love how it shows these weird plants and animals co-existing in different ways.  The story itself with the humans is a bit of a slow-burn, but it starts to really get into it after a couple episodes, and I quickly got invested in their stories in different ways.  Not everyone is likable (one of them being pretty far from it), but they're written well enough to feel invested in their respective stories.\n\nI'm not sure how likely it is, but I really hope we get another season.  Such a unique, well thought out sci-fi series with great animation.  But if it isn't, I'd say it's still satisfying the way it is.  It has one of those endings which wraps up a lot of the season's arc so it could serve as an ending, but sets up certain ideas for a potential continuation.",

I didn\u2019t think it was quite as good as either of those, and was a bit slower with the plot than I would\u2019ve liked, but definitely still worth watching. \n\n**Broad city** : Very funny. The Fred Armisen character in season 1 still cracks me up, my wife and I constantly quote \u201cI\u2019m just a baby\u201d to our puppy. \n\n**X-men \u201897** : Amazing. Animation and comic book characters obviously go so well together but ever since that golden era of the original series + Batman: TAS + Justice League , etc. where there was awesome animated shows with well thought out plots (not aimed solely at kids) there has been a huge void that this had done en excellent join filling. So glad the next season is already in development. \n\n\nCurrently watching: \n\n** Black Sails** : rewatching this series and somehow enjoying it even more than before. The set, cinematography, acting, writing, all superb. \n\n**The gentlemen** : just 1 episode in but great start. Classic Guy Richie, will be interesting to see how he handles show format versus movies. \n\n**3 body problem** : just 2 episodes into this one but liking it so far. I started reading the book but the character list at the beginning was too daunting lol I\u2019m a sucker for good sci-fi though. \n\n**Manhunt** : Also only 1 episode in.

However, this one, despite a strong lead performance from Jeff Daniels, really fumbles the execution despite a strong start. There's one really interesting plot, the murder of an ex-police officer, but the show inexplicably spends it's time on stories about: a character (whose actor looks ten years older than his supposed contemporaries in the show) struggling with his sexuality while inexplicably hopping trains(??) to leave town, a unionization drive at a dressmaking plant and a ridiculous subplot about vigilante killing in a secret police society (?!). \n\nI'm of course not expecting The Wire but I don't think Mare of Easttown is too high a bar too hit given the money Amazon obviously spent on this show. An interesting premise and location for a show that was capable of being really good (there is an excellent early extended scene at a wedding) but fumbled by a severe imbalance between focusing on the actual crime (in a crime show) versus building up the background characters, as well as some casting choices that don't hit.

Looks good and performances are solid (especially the teenage characters) but the show can\u2019t decide what it is. It tries to be a mystery and a teen/family/small town drama at the same time and that compromise means it does both things poorly. So many tangents that ultimately aren\u2019t that important, various characters have past traumas that may or may not be related to the story but we hear about it regardless, and the recounting of those traumas feels, at times, gratuitous. Basically none of the adult characters are likeable, especially the ostensible protagonist author, who inexplicably develops a deeply loyal connection to a teenage murder suspect and unquestionably believes him completely without much of a good reason except for\u2014guess what\u2014that gosh darn past trauma again. \n\nIn short the show suffers from what many modern \u201cmid\u201d tv shows suffer from\u2014it has the technical pieces you\u2019d expect from a \u201cgood\u201d show but ultimately is trying to do too much.\n\nI\u2019m sure it makes a lot more sense as a true crime book where this kind of broad scope and detail would make more sense and feel right.

In my opinion, the six-episode first season is pretty decent and enjoyable to watch. Nothing too special at the moment, or maybe it gets better in the following two seasons.\n\n  \n**The Americans (S4):** This show is consistently good and memorable, but somehow this season is weaker than the first two seasons. I did not rate S3 much highly either, as it did not reach the level set in the first two seasons, but I still enjoyed it as it is worth watching. Often a slow-burn at times, S4 concludes a few storylines and plans on moving in new directions, as seen in the season finale. In my opinion, the only irritating element in S4 is the annoying nature of Paige. Overall, I enjoyed this season, but I am hoping things get better. I can't wait to get started with S5!",

A grand narrative is only as good as its lore.  To do this would require to think in a kind of geopolitical sense - mapping out histories, geography, ideological tensions, political and religious structures, etc.\n\nAnd so, in failing to understand life in geopolitical terms, screenwriters are unable to come up with compelling situations which allow for such political intrigue to occur.   What are the mechanisms for conflict and why do human beings tragically fall for it and/or who can prevent it?\n\nBottom line, the modern screenwriter and the modern producer's brain is looking in all the wrong places for gold.

I couldn\u2019t really read her face and emotions. It was really bizarre. In courtroom scenes, they would move the camera to Lily Gladstone, and you will see disgust, anger, sadness or happiness, relief, etc. Then they will show Riley just standing there, looking blank and maybe slightly sad/confused. I had no idea what the character was supposed to portray. I have not read the books or followed this case outside of this series. But Rebecca\u2019s obsession with Warren and indifference towards Reena seemed quite infuriating. Again, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what was supposed to be portrayed or Riley\u2019s weird/bad acting was doing injustice to Rebecca\u2019s complex character.!<",

I just found Rebecca's motivations to be confusing. \n\nApparently, the real-life Rebecca Godfrey helped adapt the book for the screen, but died before it went into production.

I've been devouring as many as I can get my hands on.\n\nHere are some I'm caught up on and love:\n\n* ***Mr Inbetween*** (This is right up there with ***Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul*** as one of the best crime dramas\u2014*crime dramedies?*\u2014ever. Don't @ me.)\n* ***Colin From Accounts*** (The new season is so goddamn funny. This is one of the best comedies of the past decade, handily. Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer's chemisty is amazing, which makes sense considering they're married IRL.) \n* ***The Newsreader*** (Highly recommended for anyone who likes character-driven dramas with a good dash of humor. Anna Torv is incredible.)\n* ***Deadloch*** (I know some folks find one main characters to be pretty abrasive at the start, but give it a couple episodes.)\n* ***Upright*** (The second season gets a little goofy, but the first season is near flawless.)\n* ***Please Like Me*** (Okay, still on season three of four, but it's fantastically unique and heartfelt.)\n* ***A Moody Christmas / The Moodys*** (This was originally a limited series called ***A Moody Christmas***, but then got a second season and was renamed to just ***The Moodys***.)\n* ***Australian Survivor*** (This is even better than US *Survivor*, and three of the last four seasons have been straight bangers. It's Survivor on steroids.)\n* ***No Activity*** (Most of its dialogue is improvised, and also features Patrick Brammall and Darren Gilshenan, who you'll see in multiple of the above and below shows.)\n\nAnd here are some more mystery/crime-focused shows I've completed and think are solid-but-not-amazing:\n\n* ***Population 11***  (well, it's more of a comedy-mystery)\n* ***Black Snow***\n* ***Troppo***\n* ***The Tourist***\n* ***Top of the Lake*** (well, the first season is in New Zealand, the second is in Australia)\n\nOnes I'm only partway through, so I can't vouch for them fully, but are promising:\n\n* ***Totally Completely Fine***\n* ***Wolf Like Me***\n* ***Wellmania***\n* ***The Letdown***\n* ***Fisk***\n* ***High Country***\n* ***The Tourist*** (first season is in Australia, second is in Ireland)\n\nShows I'm looking forward to starting:\n\n* ***Boy Swallows Universe***\n* ***Class of '07***\n* ***Glitch***\n* ***Rosehaven***\n* ***Upper Middle Bogan***\n* ***The Other Guy***\n* ***Heartbreak High***\n* ***My Life Is Murder***\n* ***Mystery Road***\n* ***Rake***\n* ***Utopia*** (not to be confused with other shows with the same title)",

Expecting I'll drop this one too soon. There's something off with all of it. All their shows feel expensive yet very cheap at the same time. Episodes are incredibly short. I get a feeling that the way they construct and pace their episodes is supposed to maximize the amount of minutes they can keep eyes on the screen, especially with how short a lot of younger peoples attention spans are today. But in doing so they are treating storytelling more like a product to be sold than letting the story take the drivers seat and dictate everything else. It creates a very disjointed experience that often leaves the viewer without anytime to really learn anything about the world or characters. It's depressing honestly. What do you guys think?",

First two presentations were a little weaker, but Paul Robalino\u2019s presentation might be the best yet, as was the discussion after. Just a great group of funny people",

Was a bit disappointed in the creative choice 2 minutes into the first episode, but I'm getting over it.  I like most of the action set pieces, but for me the quality looks a little bit cheap for Star Wars.  Still, in the realm of live action Star Wars TV, this is in the Very Good category, so I will likely keep watching.\n* **Dark Matter**:  Probably my favorite show we're watching right now.  Each episode builds on the last.  Joel Edgerton has been a highlight of the series, but the supporting cast has been strong as well.  Highly recommended for fans of shows like Westworld, Severance, and sci-fi in general.\n\n***Finished***\n\n* **Hacks**:  Interesting twist in that last episode, but I kind of feel like this show is getting ready to wind down.  I wouldn't be shocked if it ends with four seasons.  (Would be fitting, given the connection to the hotel industry / Vegas)\n* **Clarkson's Farm**:  We binged this over the course of a couple days, as it's an easy, low-stakes watch.  (at least until the pigs episode)  Clarkson is an ass, and probably not everyone's taste, but the support cast comes across as highly competent, particularly Charlie and Caleb.  As someone who grew up on and around farms, it's comfort TV of the highest order.\n\n***On Deck***\n\nMan, I can remember when summer used to mean reruns and reality TV.  That isn't really the case anymore.\n\n* **Outer Range**:  Just haven't had time to start this one yet, unfortunately.  It's on the list.\n* **The Bear**:  Can't wait.\n* **The Boys**:  See above.\n* **House of the Dragon**:  I'm glad we've gotten through the time skips (apparently), and I'm ready to see some dragon-on-dragon violence.  Let's get ready to rumble!\n\n***Bonus Cartoon Corner***\n\n* **My Adventures with Superman**:  Despite some of the anime inspired takes, I feel like this is one of the most straightforward and honest adaptations of the Man of Steel.  One of the rare cartoons that my wife actually tolerates watching with me.\n* **Demon Slayer**:  Speaking of anime, I just started this a few days ago.  Has some obvious parallels to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Chainsaw Man.",
