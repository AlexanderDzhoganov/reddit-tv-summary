Some predicted it would get worse because the writer (or producer?) responsible for the 1st season's Empire storyline left the series. But they were wrong. The Empire storyline in the first season was the far better part. However in the 2nd season the 1st Foundation storyline just became as good in my opinion. Only the 2nd Foundation storyline is a bit lagging in my opinion but Jared Harris carries it hard.\n\nAside from that I also enjoyed watching **Twisted Metal**. Watched it all in 3 days.

However don't let that lead you astray. As I mentioned before it's becoming a lot more engaging and in depth. To me it's somewhat of a mix of say.. X-Men and My Hero Academia if that's any consolation, if you give it a shot, maybe you'll see what I mean. It's tough to compare, but I feel it's worth checking out.

Watching the trailer, I was impressed by the visuals but remained skeptical about its live-action execution. However, after viewing the first episode, I was pleasantly surprised. The cinematography and choreography are commendable, and the additional scenes integrated seamlessly.  \nMy only critique is the simplistic dialogue. It largely consists of brief, one-liner sentences. While true to the source material, it reminds me of the style seen in B-tier fantasy TV shows like \"Hercules\" with Kevin Sorbo, \"The Magicians\", and \"Teen Wolf\".  \n\n\nProbably about a 7/10 - 8/10, great entry point to start, recommended but obviously the source material is superior.",

Both, not coincidentally, showrun by folks who made cable/broadcast tv (Nick Santora, who does *Reacher,* but before that also did *Scorpion;* and [David E. Kelley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005082/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)).\n\nIronically, [Matt Nix](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633180/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), who did *Burn Notice,* just recently did another romping silly spy show for CBS ([*True Lies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaFMv9MvXv4)) and nobody watched it, this sub categorically panned it, and it was cancelled. I thought it was fun and pretty much had the same action/drama/comedy blend that *Burn Notice* did.\n\nAlso, gotta say, the *Poker Face* shoutouts to *Burn Notice* were awesome. :D",

Almost every episode has these fantastic little character moments that make you laugh or tear up. Just a fantastic show that I will miss a lot. 10/10\n\n\n\n__What We Do in the Shadows__ - (Hulu) This season has been as hilarious as the first couple seasons. I felt last season wasn\u2019t as good, but they have hit their stride again. Nandor is one of the funniest tv characters I\u2019ve ever seen. 9/10\n\n\n\n__Hard Knocks__ - (Max) This season is following the New York Jets football team in the preseason. I feel like Hard Knocks has been going downhill the last couple years, but I must say, I\u2019m really enjoying this season. Aaron Rodgers and the team have fully embraced the film crew being there, and have made it a really fun and enjoyable season. 7.5/10\n\n\n\n__Big Brother__ - (Paramount +) Probably not a lot of Big Brother fans here, but my gf got me hooked on this show years ago and I\u2019ve been a big fan ever since. For people unaware, Cirie Fields from Survivor is on this season with her son in the house as well; and if you aren\u2019t following the live feeds, you probably don\u2019t know that this season has been absolute non stop chaos. These people are insane and this season has been insane. (Feeds have been 10/10, the show is like 6/10) \n\n\n\n__For All Mankind__ - (Apple TV) Just recently started this show, only seen the first 3 episodes, but I\u2019m really enjoying it so far. I\u2019m definitely interested to see where it goes. \n\n\n\nRecently finished: \n\n\n__Justified City Primeval__ - (Hulu) As a huge Justified fan, I was mildly excited about this show. Overall, I didn\u2019t think the show was very good. The writing and dialogue was just a little sloppy and didn\u2019t feel like Justified at all. However, I do think that the finale was pretty good, and the last 15 minutes was the best part of the show. If they decide to lean in on what happened at the very end of the finale to make another season, I will definitely be tuning in. It was nice to see Raylan Givens again though, I will say that. 6.5/10\n\n\n\n__Sharp Objects__ - (Max) My gf recently finished the book and got me to watch the show with her. What a great show! Very short but so well acted and the twist at the end was crazy. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes true crime. 9/10\n\n\n\n\n__The Night Of__ - (Max) Miniseries on HBO Max about the brutality of the American justice system. Phenomenally acted, really amazing piece of television. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it, I highly recommend it. 10/10",

Skull Island is a quick watch and very fun, I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Godzilla/Kong movies, it's a more than worthy addition to the Monsterverse.\n\nI started watching **Parks and Rec** a couple weeks back, I am now on the 4th season.

            "body": "Currently watching two superhero webtoon-based KDramas:\n\n***Uncanny Counter 2*** (Netflix) is just as much fun as Season 1 was. The superheroes here are curly-haired, wear tracksuits, run a noodle shop as their cover, and are spiritually linked to souls in heaven, and are pursuing/exorcising evil spirits who possess and prey on humans. This season, they're pursuing demons who've >!managed to kill a Counter team and absorb their powers and can also see/use the Territory!<. Drops on Netflix on Saturdays and Sundays after they are in Korea (so around 7am Pacific/10 am Eastern).  S2 is shorter than S1 (only 12 episodes, not 16).\n\n***Moving*** (Hulu. This one's a Hulu original, and not part of the Viki shared pool of shows). 20 episodes. Began dropping August 9 with the first 7 episodes, currently drops two episodes every Wednesday. The premise is >!that in the '90s the Korean government created a black ops team out of super-powered individuals. The team suddenly went dark and disappeared, dispersing and going underground. Two decades later, one teenage kid who floats and another who's survived a car crash unscathed meet at the same high school. As the mysterious \"Frank\", disguised as a delivery man, is murdering superpowered ex-agents across Seoul and asking about their children.!<\n\nSo kinda *X-Men* crossed with *Red* but y'know not really 'cause it's a Kdrama. :)\n\nI will also mention if you're hunting through Hulu for non-superhero KDrama, I loved ***Today's Webtoon***, which is a workplace dramedy, where the workplace is the editing bullpen of a webtoon division in a web portal company. Based on [a JDrama](https://www.viki.com/tv/38709c-sleepeeer-hit) (in turn based on a manga) about a weekly manga magazine.\n\n***Only Murders in the Building*** (Hulu). Still loving it. Still having a great time. Ditto ***Reservation Dogs*** (Hulu).\n\n***Futurama*** (Hulu). Feels very much the same as the original Fox run did to me, hits, misses, and all.\n\n***Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*** (HBO/Max). Man, I have missed this show so much. And it's even tighter than Season 1. We've hit the '80s. They've mostly dropped the 8mm to add VHS.  I adore a show I can not only watch for the writing, acting, and directing, but also the cinematography. Just plain amazing. And I am not a sports/basketball/Lakers fan. :)  Love the 4th wall breaking. Love the look. Love that the directors/cinematographers *looooove* film. The Larry Bird flashback scenes (in widescreen anamorphic 16mm) and the use of loose film flipping in the gate of a projector as a transitional device made me happy and then they put the cherry on top by flashing me some reel change marks. Last time I saw someone pull that trick was Fincher's *Mank.*\n\n***Ahsoka*** (Disney+). I watched *Star Wars: Rebels* on its original Disney XD run, so I am utterly loving the show.  But it was made mainly for *Rebels* fans, as it's picking up from the open-ended finale of *Rebels*. You can still watch it without having seen *Rebels*, but you're not going to have the same emotional connection to Hera, Chopper, and Sabine, not to mention Ezra who's basically just a plot coupon at this point if you haven't watched him as the main character for four seasons as a streetrat turned Jedi doing [stuff like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am9WS1FSZFw). :) Did enjoy this week's easter eggs of Clancy Brown played Ryder Azadi, the character he voiced (and who was designed to look like him) in *Rebels,* and that the Rebel Alliance is still using the codename Fulcrum for Ahsoka. Also happy that Huyang's role looks to be bigger than I thought it would from the trailers; more David Tennant always makes me happy.\n\n***Dark Winds*** (AMC/AMC+). Based on Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn & Chee detective/mystery series, this show continues to roll along as a good solid crime drama with a lot of Native/Din\u00e9 representation behind the camera (the showrunner, Graham Roland is Chickasaw). They're also having a really fun time setting the show in the '70s, when the books first came out.\n\n***Family Law*** (CW). Continues to be my current Blue Sky-ish legal drama. This is a Canadian import that stars Jewel Staite and Victor Garber. I'm hoping the CW picks up the third season ([GlobalTV's already renewed it](https://www.globaltv.com/global-greenlights-season-3-of-original-scripted-series-family-law/)).\n\nComing up for me:\n\n* 8/30. [*Archer S14*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3ueuk2NUFk) (FXX/Hulu). Final season.\n* 9/1. [*Wheel of Time* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-1OT1jxuQo)  (Amazon Prime). It's okay; I used to watch *Legend of the Seeker,* and I never wanted to read Robert Jordan. :)\n* 9/3. [*Unforgotten S5*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl47zcRao34) (PBS *Masterpiece*). We'll see if they can last without Nicola Walker.\n* 9/12. [*Welcome to Wrexham* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuiXCWk_TwQ) (FX/Hulu)\n* 9/21. [*Sex Education S4*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgJotJx8Iio) (Netflix). Final season. And probably our last time seeing Ncuti Gatwa as not-the-Doctor. :)\n* 9/25. [*The Irrational*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGBET0MOM7A) (NBC). I think this is my only new fall scripted drama broadcast tv show this season (NBC is the only network offering new scripted drama seasons this year). Mostly interested to see Jesse L. Martin take center stage after all those years as dad  on *The Flash.* 10 episodes.\n* 10/1. *Bob's Burgers S14* (Fox). Note, *The Great North* is missing from the Animation Domination lineup; [*Krapopolis*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EEBAU8M6dc) takes its slot.\n* 10/4. [*Sullivan's Crossing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liI40FeGXUU) (CW). Canadian import. Not sure it's for me, as it's Robyn Carr based, and I'm getting some Hallmark Channel vibes, but y'know. Fall season thin this year.\n* 10/4. [*Quantum Leap* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FZhJnkbcE) (NBC). I'm assuming only 10-13 episodes got made before the strikes hit.\n* 10/4. *Magnum PI* S5B (NBC). NBC saved the show from CBS only to promptly turn around and cancel it, *and* they split the 5th season in half. Only 10 episodes and we say goodbye.\n* 10/5. [*Lupin* \"Part 3\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d3ZzGL6I4A) (Netflix).\n* 10/5. *Transplant S3* (NBC). So happy my Canadian CTV import medical drama finally got picked up by NBC and that they've also stated they'll be picking up S4.\n* 10/6. [*Loki S2*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dug56u8NN7g)  (Disney+)\n* 10/15. [*Annika* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDsMFMB17FA) (PBS *Masterpiece*). I still prefer [the radio drama series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b049fg98/episodes/player) as the 4th wall breaks don't work quite as well on video, but also happy that Katie Leung gets to be as Scottish as she wants.\n* 10/20. *Penn & Teller: Fool Us! S10* (CW)\n* 10/27. [*Fellow Travelers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFm2Magoyk) (Showtime/Paramount+)\n* 10/29. [*Gilded Age* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp0zWfSmn-8) (HBO/Max). Anybody else want Julian Fellowes to go nuts and make a musical episode? :)",

Like the other shows, it's quick-witted and managed to make fun of poor america with bonkers characters and never be mean-spirited toward them.\n\nI'm only halfway through and the only thing that irks me is the potential >!romance between two characters that could be father and daugther.

The show looks great, a lot of back story I'm not familiar with (didn't watch the cartoons), but I get by. This is clearly a love child project of this guy Dave Filoni and it shows.\n\nI went back the other day to **Fargo season 2**, which I had only rewatched once, and I kind of had forgotten how somber it is (the wife with cancer, the nutty lady).

It's interesting enough and not a bad show per se, but I hate just about every single living character on this show and I get the feeling I'm supposed to like them. The ~~Murdaugh's~~ Dutton's are willing to murder innocent people and put themselves above the law, and the show justifies it all because it's their land and I guess there's something sacred about generational wealth and land ownership. I liked Jaime up until >!he killed the reporter!<, then my sympathy for him went out the window. It doesn't help that they wrote him as the biggest wimp in the history of television. Kayce is okay, but 90% of the time I don't care about his story with his wife and son, and Beth's personality can be boiled down to 'asshole.'",

Honestly, that would be FINE if it felt like the show understood that they were all bad people. Villains can be compelling, and you don't need a hero to root for. But, it feels like the show doesn't understand that they are bad people, or wants you to think that they are good people and man, that discordance is just too much for me. I read a review after the fact and the reviewer called it \"bad people doing bad things to bad people\", and that felt spot on to me. \n\nI felt the same way about the show 'Reacher'. If he were presented as a villain, or anti-hero I feel like I could have gotten into it. But it really seemed like the show thought that he was a hero, which was incredibly jarring. In contrast, I feel like the show Justified is a good example of a show about pretty much exclusively not great people, where the show understands that's the case.",

            "body": "Just finished Painkiller. I wasn't going to watch given it felt like a retread of the same ground as Dopesick but I'm glad I did.\n\nPainkiller is much more engaging. Dopesick is mawkish and wants to make you cry but didn't achieve it for me because the script/realism just wasn't there. The result was laborious acting and a bit of a dragged out downer. To it's credit, Dopesick is more informative but Painkiller prioritises entertainment - sounds inappropriate but it works for me - it's more like an Adam McKay The Big Short presentation - smarter, wittier, better written.\n\nIn Dopesick, I found the performances were a bit of an obstacle - Stuhlberg as Sackler was just too weird to the point of hamming it up, Keaton was a distraction and very \"intensely acting\" in a way I didn't enjoy. It felt like the TV equivalent of Oscar bait. The investigator/narrator in Painkiller, Uzo Aduba keeps good pace and tone and I prefer her over Rosario Dawson. Poulter was serviceable as the salesman in Dopesick but kind of tiresome to watch him as a bit of a naive dimwit. The Painkiller equivalent with West Duchovny (yes, relation) is more interesting. It shows a more sexualised approach to the sales which I would need to check the accuracy on, but it's compelling to watch with sharp dialogue. Painkiller's main addict storyline with Taylor Kitsch is not wholly convincing e.g. I don't think we really see why an addict's marriage breaks down (the reality would be very unpleasant to the point of losing sympathy with the character) but the guy is very watchable, it never dragged so I was quite forgiving. It's perhaps a good example of the difference between the two, Painkiller uses \"a mechanic\" which is direct and accessible whereas Dopesick uses \"teenage lesbian miner\" which is just layering a few too many narrative baubles on a character for me.\n\nOverall they are different styles so which one you prefer will be a matter of taste. For me, I think Dopesick needed a more The Wire approach to succeed - less familiar faces and more authentic acting and dialogue to feel real and make you really feel the tragedy whereas Painkiller was aiming for something different and executed it more successfully.",

You may think you know what a Ryan Murphy show is. But you may not have seen this one by Steven Canals. It's amazing.\n* [*ACS: The Assassination of Gianni Versace*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_qpDkF5A8)*.* All three seasons of *American Crime Story* are outstanding, but if you're into crime thrillers this one was written by BBC2 writer, Tom Rob Smith. He also did *The Class of '09.*\n* Possibly more of a 8 than a 9-10, but I also loved [*The Old Man*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgyQgOc72w)*,* which was created and showrun by the *Black Sails* guys, Jonathan E. Steinberg/Robert Levine.

In order from most fun to least fun:\n\n- Entourage (loved the writing, good actors and beautiful (naked) women);\n- Scrubs (loved everything about it)\n- The Office (the chemistry between the actors, and a fun storyline)\n- South Park / Family Guy / American Dad (used these really as a \u2018filler\u2019)\n- Trailer Park Boys (loved the stupidity of the regular shows, all extras were terrible);\n- Community (not sure what kept me hooked, probably Annie)\n- Brooklyn 99 (loved Terry and Ray, but felt too exaggerated at times) \n- Friends (quite OK, but a bit too much \u2018soapy\u2019 for me)\n- Seinfeld (apart from some episodes, just didn\u2019t grab me)\n\nI\u2019ve also watched some \u2018more complex\u2019 and longer shows like Andor, The Mandalorian, House of the Dragon, new LOTR, Black Mirror etc. But I can only watch one episode of those a day. So I prefer the simple stuff. \n\nAny ideas? Something like Entourage would be amazing. Much appreciated!",
