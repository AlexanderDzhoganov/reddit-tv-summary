They have a bunch of podcasters on it who just make jokes and sarcastic comments about the crimes. The forensic psychologists and the behavioural scientists do actually attempt to take the topic seriously. But overall it\u2019s a bad series. \n\nFinished Binging: **My Adventures With Superman** s1, finally got round to this series I\u2019d been meaning to watch it since it was released but never found the time. Binged the series in 2 days it was a lot of fun I\u2019d highly recommend. Hopefully Prime\u2019s Caped Crusader is also good! \ud83e\udd1e\n\nFinished Binging: **Bad Behaviour** an Australian mini series about a young woman revisiting memories from her time at an all girls wilderness camp where she experienced and took part in horrific bullying. I do not recommend this it was quite boring and it just veers into a bizarre story of the bullied girl fancying her bully. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso watched **Savior Complex** a 3 part HBO doc about an American missionary who went to Uganda and a few years later was accused of killing children through medical negligence. I\u2019d never heard of this case so I went in blind it was eye-opening. \n\nI also watched: **Ice Cold: Murder, Coffee and Jessica Wongso**, which is a true crime doc-movie on Netflix about a case from 2016 in Indonesia in which 2 friends met up for coffee and one of the friends suddenly started convulsing and eventually died the other friend was accused and eventually charged with her murder after claims that traces of cyanide were found during the autopsy. I\u2019d recommend this doc, it shows the trial and there\u2019s a point where they bring in someone who claims they believe Jessica Wongso is guilty based on her nose shape and other facial features. I had no idea that kind of argument was still used in the modern age so bizarre and idiotic. \n\nYet to watch:\n\n* **One Piece s1.**\n* **Dear Child (mini).**\n* **The Killing Kind (mini).**\n* **Sex Education s4.**",

Definitely a little disappointed that there won't be a season 2.\n\n2 episode into **Castlevania Nocturne**.

I mean, I love the world building, this place feels like it's been lived in, it's really layered. Also some action scenes were brilliant (I'm thinking the black lady/pickup truck scene). I think this show stands on its own, beyond the John Wick tag (in fact that whole subtitle \"From the World of John Wick\" it's a bit of an overkill imo). So yeah, I think it's good, not missing Keanu.\n\nOn the other hand, watching **Minx** doesn't give me the feeling that I'm contemplating the 70's, and I wonder why. It feels more like people cosplaying the 70's. Maybe the attires are just too pristine, Idk.  Anyway, I don't quite get the raison d'\u00eatre of this particular show.

The main arc itself wasn't the greatest, basically meandering after a couple episodes until we get to the climax in the finale.  For that reason, I can easily see why some people would be disappointed by this season, but I just loved watching all the Crowley/Aziraphale interactions and backstory.\n\n**You season 3**\n\nThe end of season 2 kind of left me weary that the series jumped the shark, and in a way season 3 didn't ease that feeling.  However, I kind of liked it because it leaned into those aspects and had fun with it.  To me it kind of felt like a twisted version of a soap opera, in all the best ways.  Still not as good as season 1, but I liked it more than season 2.\n\n**Ray Donovan**\n\nI really liked this show.  While it had its ups and downs, it did a good job portraying this criminal family that's emotionally messed up through trauma.  It can be fun and interesting to see Ray do his job as a fixer, or his father Mickey causing chaos within the family, but there's also this dark cloud that hangs over the characters which gives it a greater dramatic weight at times.  Season 5 in particular really leans into that.  And I thought the movie was a pretty good conclusion to the series.  I did think some of the ideas might have worked better if they'd built it up over a season, but it's better than if it ended after its cancellation.\n\n**Legend of Korra season 4**\n\nI thought this was a really good season, and while Avatar's ending worked better as a way to wrap up a whole series' worth of character arcs, this was still very satisfying way to end things IMO.  The Kuvira arc was a great way to raise the stakes.  Also, I really liked Korra's development throughout the season.",

I really liked that they allowed Inaki Godoy to use his natural accent in a leading role because I thought he was fantastic. Apart from one episode, I loved it all and I can't believe how well some of the very anime-y parts worked in a live action show. I have no idea if it's objectively good but it's undoubtedly a whole lot of fun. Solid 8/10 for me.\n\nThe final season of **Sex Education** was bittersweet for me. It feels like a lifetime ago when this random show came out, but I am grateful that I found it and I have genuinely loved it every step of the way. It's not a perfect show by any means but it has so much heart and preaches such positive messages. It's a show that I wish I had as a teenager.\n\nI still enjoyed the season as a whole despite the valid complaints from other hard-core fans. There are many great plot lines and moments and I can't believe that the Groff family ended up being the highlight of the season for me. I'm a bit torn between this season being too over-the-top versus it being a necessary response to the hate the LGBTQ community has faced in the real world over the last year. My first impression is that it was a bit much but it didn't really bother me that much in the end. It did feel like they tried to do too many things.\n\nThe real flaw of the season is how dirty they did the two main characters. They didn't really develop them that much at all and it feels like the previous season would have been a better place to leave them both. Maybe it sounds like I'm complaining a lot but I truly was invested in the season and there were several touching and heartbreaking moments. This show will forever stay with me. Another 8/10 (quality 7ish but enjoyment easily a 9)",

I got vertigo from the rapid onset of the worst trope in all tv, the best friend hallucination, which feels waayy unnecessary into their struggle even coming from a last season recap. Season 1 did a good job of building the slow dread of hunger and isolation. But, that's been dropped and instead they are both super desperate, but at other times seemingly just newly stranded. Awkward writing with the forced plot point drops is just bearable. \n\n**Tulsa King** The most 7 a show can be. Pretty fine to just watch and Stallone is better than I thought he would be. \n\n**Afterparty Season 2** had extremely good episodes and oddly dull ones but overall I enjoyed it more than the first season.",

If you just want sex and decently paced action/suspense, you'll probably hate season 5.  The writers intentionally wanted to slow the story down and focus harder on character driven narratives.

The costuming had me screenshotting and Google image searching like mad. Fans of Sorry to Bother You and Insecure as well as Get Out and Us will like this BUT I hate to say it, TOBG is a pale copy compared to those inspirations. There's a few major issues: \n\n--The core idea is corny/silly, and the show doesn't do much to fix that. \n\n--The back and forth splicing of the 80s vs. now can be confusing and the show doesn't do much to set up or explain the relationships and history despite spending SO much time in the 80s. \n\n--Despite being 10 episodes, the show feels both stretched/hollow and over-full. It suffers from pacing and storytelling issues. The penultimate episode that shows how Hazel got where she is today is the best, IMHO, although even that has some serious flaws. \n\n--The show (and book) could have been a scathing and valuable indictment of both the overt racism and the micro-aggressions that POC face in the insular world of publishing, but it goes in this watered-down horror or thriller direction that feels very unsatisfying and under-cooked. \n\nHowever, having said all that, see the part where I binged the entire thing in one night, so it's *highly* watchable nonetheless. \n\n**Real Housewives of SLC Season 4** on Peacock. Holy cow, I can't recall the last time I laughed so hard at a HW franchise. The delulu nonsense of these women is TV gold. \n\n**Interview with a Vampire** on MAX (Limited-run AMC+ titles) finished the first season, which ends on a very clever could-be cliffhanger, or could be a fairly satisfying wrap-up if they don't get renewed. I was ready for the wreckin' crew to move on from New Orleans, as satisfying as the NOLA episodes were. The casting of Claudia was near-perfect, although the actress lacks the malicious spiteful little sprite energy Kirsten Dunst had/has. \n\n**Hitler's Circle of Evil** on Netflix--kind of falling-asleep-to material, very old-school TLC, with a mix of reenactments, archival footage and talking-head interviews with earnest, disheveled prof types. It's a deep dive into the people around Hitler and their roles, and it's fascinating, if chilling. If you get a chance and are interested, check out the work of Reich architect Albert Speer. The show uses some archival footage and some re-creations/enhancements to show his suggested work for the Third Reich and it is *suffocating*. It's a reaction I've never had to non-sci-fi architecture, so I know it must be partly contextual, but the scale and blankness of the buildings is legit terrifying. \n\n**Who Killed Jill Dando** on Netflix. Background TV, and a story I suspect is much more resonant with a Brit audience, but well done and interesting. \n\n**A Very British Scandal** on Prime. Holy crap I have never hated a person more than the Duke of Argyll after this show. What a POS! Paul Bettany excels at playing these superficially charming but dangerous and mean as a snake types, and Claire Foy shows a sexy, wild side that makes her Snow White exterior even more appealing. The show will leave you enraged at the British aristocracy and legal system, but also with a lot of mixed emotions to sort through--the Duchess of Argyll was no saint either.

I had finished Foundation, For All Mankind, Black Bird, Ted Lasso, etc, and yet there still so much more to watch.\n\nThis past week I finished:\n\n**Slow Horses S1 & S2**\\-- I finished both seasons and I want more! Love the old school spy thriller vibe of this show set in modern-day England. It's more John LeCarre than James Bond.  I liked the dark mysterious look of S1 better than the brighter-looking S2, but it was nice to see the entire \"Slow Horses\" crew out and about in S2, rather than just sitting behind decks. One of the best things I've seen Gary Oldman recently in and it's hard to believe this is the same actor who played a young Sid Vicious in *Sid and Nancy* so many years ago.  Time sure flies.  Can't wait for S3 to come about in December.\n\n**Silo S1** \\-- I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic shows and this show had a heavy \"Fallout\" vibe so I liked it even though I had some issues with the slow drip-feed of information in some of the episodes in the 2nd half of the season, but the season finale ended with a really surprising reveal, even though I thought I had figured things out.  Like with the vastly improved second season of the Foundation, I hope the same thing happens with the Silo as I really like the overall premise. I wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next season so maybe I should finally finish reading the books now.\n\n**Still Up S1 EP1** \\-- I only watched the first episode but I enjoyed it. Very cute show and since I often have insomnia, this show immediately resonated with me. I like how it set up the relationship of two main characters by having them only communicate to each other remotely, as most of the action occurs with both of them stranded in their own separate locations waiting for something to happen. This setup really reinforced that late-night feeling of solitude and isolation.\n\n**After Party S1 EP3 & EP4** \\-- I generally like murder mystery shows but this show hasn't totally clicked with me yet despite watching 4 episodes so far. It's funny but so far it feels like an extended episode of Community (a show that I really liked) where they riff on the mystery-genre, but I'm not really invested in the characters yet. I'll continue watching though.",

Probably better than the Alex Rider series Amazon also have on the go. \n\n**Wilderness** - I quite enjoyed this twisty US set British psychological revenge thriller series. Coleman and Jackson-Cohen were great in the lead roles and the story itself was paced well. \n\n**My Happy Marriage** - I enjoyed this paranormal romance anime. Very old school in its gender roles but a fun romance and I always enjoy it when characters show good growth over the course of the series. Feel like perfect limited series so it will be interesting to see where they go in a second season. \n\nNext up I\u2019m going with **King the Land**. MHM has left me in the mood for a Korean romcom!",

                    "body": "*Person of Interest* is amazing if you can deal with the network broadcast structure (I watched it weekly when it aired on CBS), and that it's a slow burn; it masquerades as typical network formula show for roughly half to two-thirds of the first season before busting out and becoming something different. However, it does also have the usual network longer-run show structure of a larger season arc that only advances in bits and pieces as a B plot while each episode has a self-contained victim-of-the-week A-plot. A lot of streaming-only viewers find it to be a tough view, because 22+-episode seasons with episodic plots isn't what they're used to, and requires a helluva lot of stamina to binge. :)\n\nTo my mind, *POI* is a more satisfying view than *Westworld* (given how the later seasons of *Westworld* go), since the former gets stronger as it goes with a fully satisfying finale, while the latter gets more fragmented and less coherent as it goes.\n\n*The Peripheral* was good and interesting, but the showrunner on it was the No. 2 on *POI,* Greg Plageman, and the creator was Scott B. Smith, so Jonathan Nolan (and Lisa Joy)'s stamp is sort of one step removed on this one. Also, [the show got take-backsies cancelled](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-canceled-amazon-season-2-renewal-1235700019/) after the first season before they could really get going.",

They have to survive 25 days and the remaining contestants split $100k or a lone survivor wins $250k. They secure resource sites and each individual is randomly assigned a survival item. If someone wants someone else's stuff they have to challenge them to a tug of war fight with a hoop in a circular ring. \n\nIt's literally survival of the fittest. The players get a bit too much into the macho bravado and unsurprisingly the strongest and cutthroat are on top but on the first episode when one of the players directly called another player a bitch I was in.",

Highly theatrical. Wasn't ready for the b-plot in episode 5, but they definitely addressed the issue from previous episodes. *edit - No episode this week.*\n* *The Swarm* continues to ramp the mystery through the use of heavy science-based dialogue. >!It took almost 3 episodes, but someone finally shed a tear for someone they were grieving over. Then it was immediately over as we hopped back into the mystery!<.\n* *Don't Hug Me I'm Scared* was a [rewatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ&list=PLDbfn8vJtB5DmFF0iHYki0stM1CiThg42). Love this show so much. It's a quick comedy/horror/musical muppet parody for anyone interested! 6 ep webseries (\\~5 mins each) followed by 6 ep tv series (24 mins each).\n* *The Irrational* feels like a mashup of all the genius helps cops procedurals. >!*The Mentalist, Lie To Me, Numb3rs, Criminal Minds*. It's got a Teresa, a Grace, and an asian detective named Cho. Anyone that's a Jesse Martin fan should love the pilot as he's in practically every scene.!<\n* *Found* is another NBC genius cop procedural. >!This one is more *Scandal* meets *SVU* meets *Franklin & Bash, Lie To Me, and Silence of the Lambs*. The pilot isn't as focused on the main character like the pilot for *The Irrational*, but Shanola Hampton is the best part so far, like Jesse Martin. The pilot did what it needed to do with introducing the team (vigilante superhero geniuses). Brett Dalton is brooding again. This show could really go either way, but I'll probably catch a few more episodes to see what happens between Hampton and Gosselaar.!< No rating yet.",

It's about humans fighting corrupt and narcissistic superheroes and mocks celebrity culture, media and marketing and the exploitation of it all.\n\nBut Gen V is super-powered young people who are all good vs (seemingly) evil humans in a corporation. It's just a standard show about young \"mutants\" with powers but with over the top blood and dicks. There's no real satire, just people whose powers require them to have some other thing people with emotional disorders might struggle with and it's pretty heavy handed with it.  The fun part about The Boys wasn't weird powers. The Seven are all standard Justice League characters but turned selfish and evil. The fun part was seeing humans trying to take down superheroes.",

The main complaint for S1 (beyond those by folks who've read the books) stemmed from the Terminus storyline, you can mentally switch off or skip through some if those scenes if you're having a hard time.",

Felt it was better than the first 6 episodes of s2 actually.",

Despite being annoyed by some things, and being a book reader, I overall liked S1.\n\nThen I saw S2 and it became my new favorite sci-fi series.\n\nA lot of the seeds that are planted in S1 come to fruition a big way in S2.  In fact, after watching S2, I've come to appreciate S1 a lot more.",

It\u2019s a 10 episode series that should have only been 3, tops. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of shows seem to get dragged our way too long & it seems be because of streaming. Not sure if that\u2019s the case with this one since it\u2019s an HBO show, but either way, it just drags after the first few episodes. If you like supernatural/thriller/suspense, but instead of actually getting any of those things, you just get long drawn out pointless conversations, then you\u2019ll enjoy this one.",
