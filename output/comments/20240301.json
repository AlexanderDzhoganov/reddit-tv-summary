But I also want to watch the 80s miniseries starring Richard Chamberland and Toshiro Mifune, which has been on my watchlist for a while and haven't got around to it. Right now I am leaning towards watching the 80s miniseries first, as whatever pacing/padding issues (that older TV in general had) and lesser production values might not be somewhat ruined by the newer miniseries with higher production values. Plus I do prefer to watch the new show when all the episodes are out. Anyway if anyone who has watched the 80s miniseries and the first two episode premiere of the new FX miniseries, what approach would you recommend? \n\nAlso I want to add that Classic Doctor Who (which I'm currently watching through Tom Baker's era story by story and it's mostly fantastic, and would personally recommend to fans of NuWho to check out Classic Who if you haven't. Particularly Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker eras, and also some of William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton if you can handle more 60s production values. Although all eras are worth watching for me personally and there are some gems in even the worst periods of Who) is one of my favourite shows. Especially when it comes to the Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker and later Sylvester McCoy eras of the show. And certain stories that have more than 4 parts (although even some 4 part episodes have this issue, and the 60s era definitely had some pacing/padding issues) suffer from pacing issues and there would be an episode where nothing really happens. Which isn't too much of an issue if the story is actually good, but Doctor Who and episodic TV in general is known for varying quality depending on importance to the story and how well-written. And I can still watch Modern Who and flip back and forth somewhat generally without much issue. But Shogun is the same story that is being told in a different way compared to the 80s miniseries.

The new show is showing more of the Japanese side of the story. In the old show they don\u2019t subtitle the Japanese to make the viewer be in Blackthorn\u2019s shoes so to speak, which worked for what they were trying to do. For me the old show was a bit of a miss, because I had read the book in the 90\u2019s and didn\u2019t watch the show until a dvd set was released like a decade later. I loved Toranaga and Mariko\u2019s side of the story in the book and the old show chipped most of that away. It\u2019s still worth a watch but for me I find this new version much more engaging.",

The US one was fun, but ultimately left me feeling kind of hollow. The UK version's overall vibe was just more pleasant. There weren't any players that I really didn't like, and the gameplay was a bit more dynamic. Having the cast made up of all \"regular\" people as opposed to the reality-star-infused cast of the US version made a huge difference for me. And I also preferred the slightly warmer, more involved host of the UK version to Alan Cumming's fun but aloof take on the role.\n\nHopefully Season 2 of the UK version will come out on Peacock soon. Until then I'm looking forward to checking out the Australian version next. I know the US Season 2 is finished now but honestly I'm not super interested knowing that it's all celebs/reality stars.",

Upbeat, quirky, but with drama mixed in. It weirdly gives me vibes of Pushing Daisies a little? Like just in terms of color and whimsy.\n\nAnyone know of any shows that feel similar? Already seen Jane the Virgin. Already know about the other Bryan Fuller shows too.\n\nEdit: Also been watching **Everybody Hates Chris**. Honestly, it should be more talked about than it is. It is incredibly funny in my opinion. If you're the kind of person who watches sitcoms and analyzes how you'd feel about the situations IRL, it can be infuriating because it's not a healthy family, but whatever, I don't put deep analysis into sitcoms.",

Secondly, right now, Asian TV shows and movies are arguably at their height of popularity as well, at least here in the States, and this series seems to be capitalizing on that fact. I would also hardly call Hiroyuki Sanada, Cosmo Jarvis, and Anna Sawai \"unknown\" actors.\n\nBut anyway, I do agree, it's definitely an amazing show.",

[Jonathan Tolins](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866038/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) is showrunner; created by Robert & Michelle King (*Evil, The Good Wife, Braindead*). Calling this a spinoff of *The Good Wife/The Good Life* is mischaracterizing it. While Elsbeth Tascione *is* the same quirky, (probably ADHD) character Carrie Preston played on those shows ([and won an Emmy for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqy4i4kYj84)), this is a very different formula and tone from either of those shows. It's a *Columbo*\\-like howdunnit, not an ensemble legal drama. And Elsbeth, formerly a Chicago lawyer, is now an outside observer of the police in NYC. What *Poker Face* is to streaming originals? *Elsbeth* is for CBS broadcast procedurals. If you need a \"Blue Sky\" episodic crime procedural? This could be it.\n\nThe regular cast trio (Carrie Preston, Wendell Pierce, and Carra Patterson) has already gelled, and their bouncing lines off each other is a joy to behold. There is also a rotating guest-of-the-week (the pilot's, with a nod to Preston's *True Blood* fans, was Stephen Moyer).\n\nI also started up [***The Tourist S2***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFJjZUvAbDQ) (Netflix) instead of *Sh\u014dgun*, because I am a [Harry and Jack Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_and_Jack_Williams) fan. And while *The Tourist* hasn't unseated *The Missing/Baptiste* as my favorite of their BBC/ITV crime thrillers, I enjoyed S1 enough on HBO/Max to be sad when HBO cancelled it, and thrilled that Netflix picked it and the new second season up. The action has moved from Australia to Ireland, and the amnesiac protagonist is landing smack dab in the middle of his still-forgotten past. Jamie Dornan and Danielle Macdonald continue to knock it out of the park.\n\n***Avatar: The Last Airbender*** (Netflix). I loved it, but I'm probably less connected to the OG show than most here, having come to it as an adult in my late 30s when it aired on Nickelodeon rather than my formative years.  And knowing the live-action show was going to be 8x1hr. episodes, I had already anticipated the pace was going to be more ponderous and the tone not as light as the animated series. It did take me half of the first episode to acclimate to all the changes (because who hasn't binged through AtLA half a dozen times?) but it grew on me. And I'm kind of amazed they cast the show so well that I could instantly recognize every character when they first appeared. For me, the standouts were Dallas Liu as Zuko, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Iroh, and Kevin Leung as Zhao. YMMV. :D Hope we make it all the way to S3.\n\nAlso watching, but basically just holding steady and not much to say: [**The Bad Batch S3**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa5zeHdSwdQ) (Disney+); *The Good Doctor S7* (ABC, and glory hallelu, it's the final season \\[grin\\]; but I still like the new intern characters). *The Rookie S6* (ABC)*, CSI: Vegas S3* (CBS)*, Equalizer S4* (CBS), *The Way Home S2* (Hallmark Channel), *The Great North* (Fox)*, Resident Alien* (Syfy)*, Tracker* (CBS), *Feud: Capote vs. the Swans* (FX) and *Family Law S3* (CW).\n\nComing up for me (links go to Youtube trailers):\n\n* 3/3.

Just a fantastic episode and one of the more real depictions of mental illness I\u2019ve ever seen on television.\n- also, episode 2 continues to be one of my favorite comedic episodes of television ever. His funeral rap never fails to make me laugh so hard that I cry.\n\n**Abbott Elementary:** Barb triggered some youth group memories of seeing some sort of dance skit related to \u201cShackles\u201d that I had long since buried, but I absolutely loved her getting her recital. I was hoping she would >!drop the rude church choir but I actually loved that instead, she put her own spiritual relationship ahead of the pettiness and just went about her day.!< Sheryl Lee Ralph was a delight this week, that\u2019s all.\n- that\u2019s not all, actually, because I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention how much I love Zach and how hard he made me laugh all episode. The cut from Jacob saying \u201cI bet he\u2019s fuming\u201d to an enraged Zach in his car was maybe my favorite moment of the episode.\n\n**The Floor:** what can I say, I love trivia, game shows and Rob Lowe, so there was no way I was missing this. I was pretty unsatisfied with the conclusion this week, >!with Jacqueline winning the 250K despite only winning 3 duels the entire run? GENE WAS ROBBED.!< it was an interesting set-up though and I\u2019m wondering how a season 2 might differ now that we\u2019ve seen different strategies play out.\n\n**UP NEXT:** we are so overdue on Better Call Saul it is not even funny anymore.

The characters all have very strong accents and sometimes speak in at least one other language besides English, but the subtitles spell out the accents and use the foreign words instead of translating them:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/504bc5147b8db1c1e44c4c4198009691.png\n\nI'm not sure if I consider this a good thing or a bad thing. It adds to the flavor of the setting, but I'm really curious about the the non-English parts and the accents are so heavy that sometimes I have to pause and rewind just to reread the subtitles. \n\nThe episodes are generally quite short (15-20 minutes) and there are only six episodes, so it's a quick watch.\n\nEdit: Much of it is in Nigerian Pidgin English.

But that integration was a community-made plugin, which has been broken for me for months. So I have to manually log things on Trakt, but then I also recently started using a smaller app called Simkl. I has a bad name and a (very) small user base, but the app/website itself is pretty slick. I was able to import my watch history from both Trakt and Letterboxd into Simkl, which was pretty seamless.\n\nI find the discover/search functionality of Simkl is really awesome for finding new stuff to watch, with lots of really complex filtering. Only want Australian shows that include the genres comedy and/or thriller, but not mystery? You can do that. It's pretty granular.",

Despite being through three episodes, I could tell you almost nothing about their culture. The show has just rushed to conflict.

Foreshadowing, exposition, close ups, music, photography, it's so in your face that the only thing to watch is how the chaos will go down, which is entertaining sometimes but also just way too stupid that you end up losing your suspension of disbelief altogether. Like they want to show you the dude got high off the drugs that were left in the cup of water, so they zoom in the cup after he drank and it looks like all the drugs are still in the cup because just leaving a little undissolved would be too subtle or just not zooming in at all and just remembering they were put in the only cup in the scene is too much brain work? At least the killings/motives are somewhat complex but then we see them go down before the MC solves them(which is everytime) so the only thing you look forward to is the chaos and the unwinding of the story, but even that is often telegraphed so bad. Anyway, maybe it's not for me, and just a twist on the genre that works for other people. Love Natasha Lyonne tho, really gives the character some life and realness",
