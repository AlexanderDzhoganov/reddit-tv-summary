It used the same location and actors as the tv series. And it was originally planned to be an immersive theatrical performance, but... 2020.\n\nSo there we all were in lockdown, marching through the entire day together on a livestream on Facebook (both the HBO and Sky Arts accounts had it in two six-hour chunks) with a live comments stream. Watching stuff like >!a last supper at the seashore happening as the tide rolled in to engulf everybody up to the waist; or Jude Law dig his own grave for about 90 minutes!<. A singular, unique and highly intensive, visceral streaming tv experience I don't think I'll ever see the like of again. \\[I kept having the random thought that Punchdrunk was jealous about [the Port Talbot Passion](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/apr/26/michael-sheen-the-passion-port-talbot) and wanted to do their own all-day stations-of-the-cross piece.\\]\n\nIt is, btw, not necessarily meant to be watched like a drama, but more as kept on in the background.  You can still watch all 12 hours if you want:\n\n* [https://www.facebook.com/SkyTV/videos/the-third-day-autumn/1839589106179956/](https://www.facebook.com/SkyTV/videos/the-third-day-autumn/1839589106179956/)\n* [https://www.facebook.com/SkyTV/videos/the-third-day-autumn/648960352718156/](https://www.facebook.com/SkyTV/videos/the-third-day-autumn/648960352718156/)\n\nBut HBO edited together a 2-hour version of all the bits where stuff happens plot-wise if you didn't want to spend a half an hour just walking across the causeway, etc.. :D\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcZvNbt1ooA&t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcZvNbt1ooA&t=31s)\n\nSidenote: another surreal Jude Law\u2013starring series by Sky that made it to HBO/Max were the Paolo Sorrentino series: [The Young Pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6we2blItR4s) / [The New Pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdvNxBtWuo)*.*",

Gregory >!talking about how it\u2019s the little things that remind him of his mom had me sobbing, and I loved everything about him and Barb talking at Top Golf.!<\n- As someone who doesn\u2019t like >!Kevin Hart!<, the B-plot didn\u2019t vibe with me this week. I think we all knew >!there was no way Kevin Hart was Janine\u2019s father!< but it\u2019s always nice to see the Brunchy Bunch.\n\n**Hacks:** first of all, episode 3 - they absolutely put Kaitlin Olson in that dress to make her look like a bird, right? Because the parallels between Sweet Dee and DJ have never felt so strong as in \u201cThe Roast of Deborah Vance\u201d, and I loved it. Never has there been such a supremely funny woman been so spectacular at playing characters who are so bad at comedy. >!Still, I delighted in seeing DJ get some wins this week.!<\n- also, there is maybe no greater Deborah Vance moment than >!her petty ass taking all the toilet paper from those old men shitting their brains out.!< not kidding when I say I CACKLED.\n\n**X-Men 97:** I watched the original 90s cartoon on occasion as a child and only paid attention to the X-Men films every now and then, but even just slightly more than passing knowledge was enough to make this such a delightful watch. The episodic storytelling was done so well, the characters were so fleshed out, and there were SO many moments that were straight up phenomenal. So excited to get to the finale. \n\n**Fallout:** I\u2019ve never played any of the games, but my SO has played a couple of them, and we both liked it a lot. Give Walton Goggins all the love and appreciation he deserves. Some cringy writing in moments but overall, a very entertaining watch and a compelling narrative. Definitely excited about a season 2.\n\n**Up Next:**\n- Shogun\n- The Bear (I\u2019ve seen both seasons, my SO has not and I need him caught up by season 3 premiere time)\n- The Last of Us",

Show just gets richer with every character they introduce and it's slowly moving away from the procedural element to more serialised story telling, which is more to my taste. \n\nAnyway, I'm a sucker for tv shows that start off rough and blossom into something great.

The choreography is pretty underwhelming like Reese has some serious plot armor. I get he\u2019s supposed to be a super star ex-CIA dude, but the choreography of fights and shooting is just pure plot armor. Sometimes someone would pin him with a gun, so he just takes it from them. And sometimes they do and we\u2019re supposed to take it seriously. He only shoots bad people in the leg so he never kills anyone\u2026 lol, ok. Some people die from one shot to the shoulder some just keep fighting. In one episode he literally shots a guy with a sniper rifle from like 3 feet away and the guy just gets knocked out... ok. I get it\u2019s a cable show and want to remain PG, but come on. The jokes are painful \u201cMr Reese, we have a new number\u201d \u201cbut I\u2019m a busy person Finch\u201d that\u2019s the level of most of the comedy.

It works whenever they want it to work, and doesn\u2019t work when they don\u2019t want it to work.

Only Will Forte and David Wilmot is keeping me interested in it. Robyn Cara is pretty good as well. But the story is all over the place and goofy at times. I'm surprised the Obama's are executive producers on this, not sure why they'd be interested in a story like this.\n\nEDIT2: Someone spoiled that **Sugar** has a twist in it around ep 6, and I'm honestly glad I read that because that's the only reason I decided to give it a chance. I'm still not sure about it, it's very weird. If I wanted hollywood detective vibes I prefer them funny like Psych. But with the twist revealed I might finish out the season at the very least.",

If you had told me at the end of the show that >!id be crying over nathan flying into the sky and dougie breaking down!< I wouldn't have believed you. \n\nIt's shot like a Safdie movie of course and their anxiety inducing camera shots mesh perfectly with Nathans style of acting and humor. And they're so good at building dread. Of course Daniel Lopatin's ambient stress-core synths. \n\nSpeaking of Safdie, Dougie was probably my favorite character. I love seeing Benny act. Emma and nathan of course are great. Emma captures the perfect oblivious privilaged white girl who thinks shes helping. Nathan plays an excellent selfish pathetic coward. also shout out to Abshir, Nala, and her sister.",

It was a UK/US co-production. In it, Patrick McGoohan plays John Drake, an international espionage agent for NATO.

And he began developing the *The Prisoner* with a bunch of the writer/producers of *Danger Man/Secret Agent.* Most fans assume *The Prisoner* is a sequel to *Danger Man/Secret Agent*, helped along by the US theme song, [\"Secret Agent Man\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0u3-Gbu88) (which has the lyric: \"They've given you a number and taken away your name.\")",

The episodes are 7 minutes long, so it's not a huge time investment to taste it. Do not let the fact that it is a preschool show deter you. I'm single, childless, and in my late 50s and I've probably binged the 150+ episodes over five times by now. :D  It may not appeal at the very beginning, but get at least to episode 5 (\"Shadowlands\") before making up your mind.\n\nOn Netflix, there are a number of fantasy/science fiction animated series for kids I also adore and love. And when the show has to be TV-PG and the episodes are only 23 minutes long? the writing has to be super-tight. I always recommend *Hilda*, *Trollhunters* (and the subsequent Tales of Arcadia shows)*,* and *Kid Cosmic. Trollhunters* was created by Guillermo del Toro and showrun by Marc Guggenheim (of Arrowerverse fame). *Kid Cosmic* by Craig McCracken (the OG *Powerpuff Girls*). And if you loved *Avatar the Last Airbender/Legend of Korra, The Dragon Prince* shares some DNA as two of the creators worked on AtLA as head writer and director.  If you can deal with puppets? *Dark Crystal: The Age of Resistance* also kicks butt.\n\nIf you want something more TV-MA, *Blue-Eye Samurai* on Netflix, or Genndy Tartakovsky's *Primal* on Max both deliver in spades. *Blue-Eye Samurai* has one parallel with *Shogun,* in that the showrunners are a married couple with a white husband and a mixed-race Japanese American wife. In the case of *Blue-Eye Samurai,* the husband is Michael Green, who co-ran S1 of *American Gods* with Bryan Fuller and created/showran *Kings*.\n\nIf it has to be live action, and you need some cozy comfort shows, among older series, I'd recommend *Last Tango in Halifax* (Netflix) by Sally Wainwright, and the *No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency* (Max), and *Julia* (Max). Among current series, if you want some Blue-Sky-ish fare *The Way Home* (Peacock), *The Lincoln Lawyer* (Netflix), *Family Law* (CW Canadian import starring Jewel Staite and Victor Garber), and *Elsbeth* (CBS/Paramount+) may also work.",

Like watching Sicario the TV show. \n\n**SEAL Team**  Only got a couple of episodes into this and was hoping it would be more like Lioness but instead it is just a standard CBS procedural masquerading as a show about special forces. \n\n**Star Trek: Discovery** Another show I really wanted to like but didn't really care for.  Only watched the first couple of episodes so please feel free to tell me if it gets better. \n\nProbably going to try ST: Strange New Worlds, 1883, and 1923 before I drop Paramount. \n\n**Dark Matter** It is starting to feel that there are too many recent shows about multiverse/alternate dimensions and they are all treading similar ground just with different actors. Having said that, it seems like a fine show and I don't have any complaints about the actual show. \n\nExcited for the finale of **Sugar** to see if they can pull this all together satisfactorily.  One of my main questions has been \"was the twist even necessary?\"  This is a very short show with only 8 episodes at roughly 30 minutes each so it makes me wonder if the show shouldn't have just focused on the A plot noir detective and just skipped trying to shoehorn in the B plot in such a limited amount of time.  The A plot seems to be good enough to stand on its own anyway.  Guess we'll find out Thursday night.\n\nAlso excited to see what happens with **Outer Range** returning this week.  S1 was all mysteries and no answers and apparently that rubbed some of the cast/producers wrong on the show so I'm hoping we get some explanations this season.",

[**Blanca Season 1 done**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7950716/)**.** I hate the pacing on this show, the acting is subpar, the music is atrocious - they cut to this annoying rap song that's not even good EVERY DAMN TIME Blanca achieves something in the show. The stupid song is seared into my mind. I watched the show for Linneo the dog played by Fiona. I held on for that little squishy huggable hound. I just need someone to take all the dog's scenes, merge them and I'll watch that gladly. Linneo deserved a better show.\n2. [**La Casa De Flores season 1 and 2.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8387348/)\u00a0 I got bored by\u00a0the end of season 2.\u00a0 I'll come back to it. Paulina is legendary with that manner of speaking that cracks me up, and she's witty. Paco Leon in dresses and heels is not something I expected to be THAT intriguing but it is.  I ended up watching a few movies with him, he's really talented.\u00a0\n3. [**T\u00fa tambi\u00e9n lo har\u00edas**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18988142/) - What an absolute thrill.\u00a0 I love these kinds of tight-space stories where everyone is an unreliable narrator or witness\u00a0- some intentionally not so much and people's secrets just get spilled in such a tight space. \n4. [**The Recruit** ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/)- couldn't move past episode 1, hated it.\n5. [**Fubar** -](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13064902/) I detest his daughter, I got to a point where I was ready to ffwd whenever she was on screen but I couldn't because stuff was happening.\u00a0 It's not a great show but I wanted to see old Arnie. Their \"Guy In The Chair\" is okay, not hilarious or uber-smart but does offer some light comic relief.\n6. [**Will Trent**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17543592/) - This is a show I text and scroll through. Season 1 was a yawn and  I generally don't care for the books but I do like season 2 even though the big bad dude of each episode is easily identified in the first act and I generally don't really like\u00a0the characters except for Betty, Will and sometimes Amanda.\u00a0 Season 2 Episode 7 has be rethinking my indifference to Faith - she's a badass.  Episode 8 at the gun range feels like I've seen it in CSI, NCIS, Elementary, The Code tv series, Seal Team and whichever popular procedural I watched way back when when they had an episode about military coverups and the like. So yeah, this show is a background show perfect for doing anything but paying attention to what's going on.",

I'm a big written SF fan so have pretty high standards for SF shows; Dark Matter mines the exact same territory as the now-canceled Constellation on Apple TV with a nod to parallel realities, alternate selves, quantum blah blah, and looks about as successful as Constellation was. Pretty to look at, not much interesting going on despite convluted plots and character arcs. Honestly, the X-Files used to do stories like this 24 times a season and Rick and Morty make fun of the parallel universe tropes in under two minutes. This is not awful, but definitely falls into the 'Mid TV' critique that was in the NY Times a couple of weeks ago that touched heavily on Apple TV shows.\n\nBeing a fan of Parks and Rec, Community, Trial and Error, etc.., we're always looking for similar wonky and fun workplace comedy shows and had some reasonable hopes for Unstable, a Rob Lowe dramedy that got recently renewed by Netflix for a second season. However, this one just gets off on the wrong foot, Lowe isn't the right casting for an eccentric but lovable tech mogul, in a premise that felt like it has been sitting around in a writer's notebook for quite a few years. The nepo casting of his real life son as his son in the show doesn't help the slightly off vibe of the whole premise and the show is heavy on sentimentality and light on good laughs, at least early on. Comedies sometimes take a while to gel but this one doesn't seem worth putting a lot of time into, especially given that it's executive produced and starred in by the Lowe duo, a bit too much power both on screen and off screen for those two.\n\nWill bounce around between Sugar, Manhunt and Ripley next.",

It was just visually stunning.\n\n-Ghosted: Omfg. So many good people; such a bad show. A fun watch even after it pivots halfway through the season. I had hopes for it developing into something.
