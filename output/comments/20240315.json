Best describable as neo noir detective drama with a realistic depiction of how much politics interfere with police work. If you liked The Wire I think you'll like this one. It's also very refreshing to see normal family relations between all parties of a divorced marriage. Writers like to put in some forced drama and we often see teenagers acting resentful towards one or both parents or one spouse hates the other for some strange reason,etc.. There is none of that here, just couple(s) who figured out they don't function well together and decided to move on. I'm emphasizing this solely to try to better depict how good the writing is without giving any spoilers. It proves scripts can be excellent without fake family drama. Show started good and just keeps getting better. I just finished season 4 and it ranks as one of the best seasons of any tv show I've ever seen, watch it.",

I know the Game of Thrones comparisons might seem reductive, but it does give me similar vibes to the early seasons--just really well-written political intrigue, plus some added culture shock fun and a decent amount of blood. It's incredibly well acted (Hiroyuki Sanada is especially incredible, but everyone is great), well written, and respectful and faithful to 1600s Japan from what I know. I'm sure some might be put off by the vast majority of it being in Japanese with subtitles, but it doesn't bother me. My old man ass always has subtitles on anyway! I highly recommend it.\n\nModern Family: Random, but I've been rewatching this as I go to bed for the last few months and it's just a solid, dependable show. I'd watched the first couple seasons back in the day, but I'm through season 8 now and I'm surprised at how well it mostly maintains its quality as it goes along. Sure, it starts repeating itself or the characters sort of go through the same arcs over and over--but we're not here for that! We're here for well-written comedy performed by a stellar cast. It really is impressive that there's hardly a weak link--and in a show with multiple child actors, that's especially impressive. It's not ground breaking, but it's just a really well made show.",

I\u2019ll keep watching weekly to see where it goes. \n\n\nI\u2019m doing a rewatch of **ER**, which I watched when it first came out so I\u2019ve forgotten specifics. Still in s1 (there are A TON of looong seasons\u2026.I\u2019m on e10) and the last episode I watched was a real nail-biter. The cast is just absolutely phenomenal, both the main cast as well as supporting. It\u2019s a comfort show for me in a lot of ways and I can do other things while watching it since I\u2019m already familiar with basic plot lines. \n\nAnother comfort series is **The Dog House UK** which just released a new season (HBOMax). It\u2019s adorable and sweet and heartwarming \u2014 the premise is that people, couples and families come to this sprawling dog shelter to find their forever dog. You get backstories of the folks as well as the dogs and the production value is high. I\u2019m not usually a fan of reality tv (aside from the occasional cooking series) but this one is tops for me\u2026.always gives me lots of smiles and feels.\n\nOn the opposite side of smiles is the new Netflix docuseries, **Turning Point \u2013 The Bomb and the Cold War** which is on par with PBS **Frontline** docs and nearly as well done as Ken Burns docs\u2026.and Ken Burns docs are categorically some of the best out there, imo. Anyhow, this is a DEEP DIVE \u20149 hour long episodes (I\u2019ve only watched a few so far) starting on the development of the Atomic Bomb and then moving on to McCarthyism, followed by Stalin-era Communism, the various covert (and not so covert) actions of American/British/French governments etc along with the CIA, Reaganism and on. It\u2019s heavy af but I\u2019m learning more about this stuff than I ever did in all my years in school or via other programs/books.",

One episode at a time is enough. Post apocalyptic science fiction Western series. Some fantastic characters and portrayals of them, and set amongst some really novel world-building and a good depth of lore. It's ten years old now, and although it mostly feels perfectly fresh enough, I find myself thinking of it as more dated than it really is. I think that's probably just because some of the alien costumes and make-up is reminding me of much, much older series though. Anyway, it scratches a certain Sci fi itch  and I'd recommend it to anyone who's got a gap of that sort that needs filling. Give it until episode three before you make up your mind I'd say, as it's gradually finding its feet to start with. \n\n***Marco Polo*** - because I needed to deal with the historical fiction bug the first two episodes of ***Shogun*** gave me, whilst I wait for the series to finish so's I can watch the rest of them back to back. I'm enjoying Marco Polo, and I'm really surprised to see how utterly slated it got in critics' reviews at the time. It's not amazing, but I'm finding it interesting, well acted, and well produced so far. And you can't go wong with Benedict Wrong. It's a bit slow at times though. \n\n***Not Dead Yet*** - watched S01E01 a while back and didn't like it. Series two's been well reviewed so I gave it another go with S01E02, and it's growing on me a bit.\n\n***The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin*** - if you like Noel Fielding (I do) then you'll love it. If you don't, you won't.\n\n***Tokyo Vice*** - Shogun's fault again, inspiring a desire for stuff set in Eastern cultures. Finally watched the end of S01 after starting it last year, and then able to move straight on to S02. It's a really solid, well-balanced drama series that does a great job of presenting a foreign culture without patronising it or denigrating it, but not idealising it either.\n\nAnd now I have the final 3 episodes of ***Halo*** to watch, ***Constellation*** piling up for when I'm in the mood to binge that - and ***3 Body Problem*** locked and loaded, which I'm looking forward to most of all...",

I'm a lifelong Star Trek fan and The Orville is just as charming, relevant and rewatchable.  I fall in love with it again every time I watch.  \n\nComfort show:  The Middle - So fun.  We finished Modern Family a couple of weeks ago and decided to watch a sitcom about a more relatable family.  We live in the Midwest and while we can relate to the family conflict in Modern Family, the setting and characters in The Middle just make more sense to me.  I am particularly impressed by the sibling dynamics in The Middle.  It reminds me a lot of my own siblings - my brother is a little bit younger than me, and our sister was a bit of a surprise, born 8 years after my younger brother.  That was our family structure, same as The Middle.  Some of the best laugh out loud funny moments are the children all by themselves.",

These were all crime thrillers that hopped about chronologically (*Rellik* was actually backwards), and *The Missing/Baptiste* and *The Widow* had cross-border elements. \\[trivia note: they were also the producers of *Fleabag*\\].\n\n*The Tourist* is a departure from their usual crime thriller. It was produced by the BBC but S1 was shot in Australia, and instead of a lot of time-hopping, you had an amnesiac protagonist. S1 aired on HBO and streamed on Max until it got dumped in the great wave of Zasclav cancellations for tax purposes. I'm incredibly happy Netflix rescued it.",

Sexual abuse, domestic- and prison- violence, organized crime and brutal executions - Banshee does not shy away when it comes exploring the dark excesses of human behaviour.\r  \n\r  \nThe main cast is excellent, everyone deliver their best. The story revolves around the trials of John \"Lucas Hood\" Doe (Antony Starr) - a criminal who's been released after being on ice for 15 years. He needs to hide from his former employer and in order to do so he takes up the mantle of a recently murdered sheriff as a disguise in the titular town of Banshee, Pennsylvania. The story goes way beyond that, even after the first few episodes that I don't want to spoil for you.\r  \n\r  \nBeside The Expanse it is probably the brightest example of using a diverse casting to its fullest advantage. Native Americans, Amish communities, Aryan gangs and many more, all are being interwoven into an interesting setting. Characters falter and prevail, show initiative, weakness, resourcefulness and fallibility regardless of their gender, race or sexual orientation.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, Banshee has an OK narrative and a mostly competent writing, but it would be quite a stretch to say it's perfect. There are undeserved deux-ex-machina rescues, several plot conveniences, multiple instances of characters doing quite the opposing things they were supposed to do just for dramatic shock value, and downright abandoned story-threads that bugged me for a while. Still, characters carry the show on their shoulders so it is easy to get hooked on just for them.\r  \n\r  \nThe show ended on its own terms which really is as common as a white raven nowadays, so you will get a complete, full story with a satisfying closure if you wish to give it a chance.",

So that got me thinking that hey, maybe if I had a time machine and went to see Lincoln, you know, living & breathing & moving, I would feel like he doesn't look like Lincoln either. Who knows. It's a tricky one, bringing to life these individuals who have become bigger than life. Anyway, I'm in with this show. \n\nRegarding **Curb**. I was thinking that my stance has changed a bit since before the premiere. Then it was, awww, so sad it's ending. Now it's more like, yeah, it's about time it's ending. Meaning, it's been a bit underwhelming. The main arch, ok, but I didn't even know about that law beforehand (I'm not from the US). So I'm not feeling this season so much. And of  course they are just too old. You know, the Sienna Miller thing for example. Or seeing Richard Lewis in the last episode...

For the most part what is on the screen is good.  My problem is that they seem to start focusing down certain storylines and then suddenly it's gone or really diminished and not finished in a satisfactory way.   Examples: \n\n- the crews downed in occupied France trying to escape.  So much time dedicated to them and we can see them still in danger but close to escape and then suddenly they're just back at the base\n\n- the storyline with Crosby and Sandra.  So much time is invested in building this up relationship and then suddenly she's gone with just a few moments to end that storyline, and again it's not satisfying.\n\n- the buildup of Rosie's progression through the war which was actually somewhat good because finally we had a pilot showing some interesting character growth...and then suddenly he's on the backburner again in favor of Buck/Bucky.\n\n- taking the time to focus on the Redtails pilots but then suddenly they just appear to be an afterthought and nothing more is done with them\n\nSo overall I liked the show but the way they did all these storylines was just so weird.  Comparing back to Band of Brothers where they also had a lot of sidestories/characters they told and then moved on but those were much more self-contained in single episodes and had more proper endings.",

Otherwise do a jump to S4. I'm not that invested in the show so I'll either wait for Prime to add S3 or cheat and read S3 reviews.

I\u2019m only part way through the first episode so it\u2019s too early to tell if it\u2019s good. \n\nFinished Binging: **A Killer Paradox** on Netflix, a South Korean show which follows >!an aimless student who accidentally kills a man one night, he later discovers the man was a wanted serial killer. Feeling he now has a purpose he takes on a vigilante role and kills killers.!< Overall, the show was ok, I was expecting a more darker tone/ cat and mouse game. But the show didn\u2019t really follow that tone. There were some good fight scenes in the show. \n\nFinished Binging: **ARA San Juan: The Submarine that Disappeared** an 8-part documentary on Netflix about the 2017 disappearance of a Argentinian Military Submarine which was carrying 44 Naval officers. It was an ok watch, a little longer than it needed to be.",

Like it feels sorta...business as usual? I guess this must have been an absolute nuclear bomb back in the late 80s or early 90s when Danny was researching it but seeing \"insurgents\" storm your own capitol building in your lifetime and then surfing into a world wide pandemic kind of...numbs one to mega-scandal conspiracy theories about just how corrupt the gov is. But also side note: It's remarkable how Christian looks so much like Danny. I wonder what playing that part in the recreations felt like. He's (Christian) so effortlessly stylish as well, he belongs on r/malefashionadvice with his frogger glasses cords and perfect 80s Ralph Lauren sweaters.\n\n**The West Wing** on HBO Max. This used to play reruns (first run? I'm old.) Afternoons on TNT and is a real comfort show. But so 90s. Insensitive terms! Someone totally unbelievable as a \"professional escort\"! A fast-talking Girl Friday with a 1930s face! \"here's a picture of a new mom and a baby to distract you from your totally reasonable request, personal assistant\" (and this works, bleh)! Here's the thing: this show is camomile tea in show form. It's delightful. But I also am watching with a very jaundiced eye. Like episode 2, a personal friend of the Prez is killed in when their plane is shot down. The president decides (it's implied) to take WAR ACTIONS because he's pissed. It's personal. That to me, despite how adorable, lovable, and wonderful that friend was, is scary as hell. The President, no matter how folksy and cute he is with that cane, shouldn't be making decisions like that!\n\n**Vanderpump Rules** on Peacock. Despite a slow start, I'm enjoying the fourth wall breaking and low-key antics of the cast. I will say JESUS have some of them aged rough (Tom Schwartz). Showing flashbacks of him, he was painfully beautiful. He's retained about 30% at most of that arresting beauty. Interesting for those that believe a face shows its owners disposition as it ages.\n\n**Sort Of** on HBO Max. Wow. This is a gem of a show. Don't sleep on it. Warm, cute, funny. My only very minor complaint is that the main character is a touch on the \"perfect minority\" side and the conflicts and solutions feel a tiny bit light so far. And how on EARTH is 7even affording that condo/house/whatever in Toronto? What do they do!?!  But for those that miss **Somebody Somewhere,** get ye to this show.\n\nMovies: **Influencer** on Shudder/Prime: a solid, satisfying (although not horror, more thriller) movie that spins what could have been thin threads into a silken web. A touch predictable in places and it doesn't go into the motivations of the main villain (which is a good choice, as they would have felt cheap/cliche at best), merely hints at them, which sometimes makes the movie feel shallow or flashy. For those that have visited or lived in SE Asia, some things are dead-on accurate, and the vibe even more so. I wish they had touched on or shown the huge, huge difference in the country and world someone like Madison experiences vs. the everyday resident, but the movie stays mostly in immaculate Four Seasons-like hotels and mansions and glowing sunset lit restaurants and rooftops.",

I wish this show was picked up by HBO or Amazon instead of FX so the show would've looked a little better but it still looks good. Kinda hard to make a bad looking show when you're shooting in Japan lol.

Not a can't miss, but I'm enjoying it.\n\n**Hazbin Hotel** was my least favourite, although to be fair my wife and I only got about ten minutes in before we decided it wasn't for us. Nicely animated, but real Baz Luhrmann musical vibes. This has apparently found an audience but it doesn't include me.\n\n**Carol and the End of the World** was one I was hoping a bit more from. I'm a fan of the book series *The Last Policeman* about a Massachusets cop who tries to hold his post to the end despite a massive asteroid about to hit Earth. Carol .. has a similar setup, with the titular character being an introverted middle-age women who is not interested in mindless hedonism or self-reflection as the end approaches but just normalacy and belonging. However, the main characters are so boring that there isn't much in the story. Made it about four episodes in this one, I think it was a good concept but the execution just wasn't there. Thinking more about this, this show is a rare case where live action would have been a better choice.\n\n**Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy** is a hospital-based female friendship comedy-drama set in a Star Wars-style multi-alien-race city/spaceport. Not quite surreal enough to be a fun Adult Swim show, not quite interesting or funny enough to be Futurama. Only made it two episodes, it might find fans from people who really like Harley Quinn or Below Decks.\n\nPretty negative on some stuff here so I will say that we are watching a combo of For All Mankind Season 1 and Shogun which is a top, top shelf combination. Also managed to see The Holdovers, Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon in the last month on streaming. Really liked the first two, Moon was 6/10ish and too long.",
