I had a massive wave of season finales hit me this week and I've still got a dozen or so hours of stuff to plow through before I can get to my streaming binges. :D But yes, it's summer. Summer is traditionally slower. However, for me, it is not completely empty. My upcoming list includes:\n\n* 5/30. [Eric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGaAl_8QW2c). (Netflix). Showrunner is Abi Morgan *(The Hour, River*). This one looks to be similar to *River,* where Stella Skarsgard played a police detective who could see/her \"manifests\" (ghosts) of the victims of the crimes he was investigating (it's up on Britbox and Freevee). This one is set in 1980s NYC, with Benedict Cumberbatch playing a television puppet performer whose son disappears while walking on his way to school.  My second most-anticipated show of 2024 behind Disney+'s [Renegade Nell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9OmmeE_gZc) (because: Sally Wainwright did *Happy Valley* and *Gentleman Jack*). \n* 5/31.[ Jim Henson: Idea Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGFV6VIxkI) (DIsney+). My week for puppets, I guess. Documentary on Henson by Ron Howard ('member, he was the director of *Willow*). All the usual suspects, rare footage including home movies.\n* 6/4. [The Acolyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtytYWhg2mc) (Disney+). So, we'll see what happens when *Russian Doll*'s showrunner, Leslye Headland gets to play with Star Wars.\n* 6/6.[ Sweet Tooth S3 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os4R9IEBOA8)(Netflix). Final season.\n* 6/8. Snowpiercer S1-S3 drops on AMC+ in prep for S4 premiere. If you didn't c catch it on Max/TNT, now's your chance.\n* 6/11.[ Tour de France: Unchained S2 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdNosghI3UI)(Netflix). So much more fun to have all the exciting bits edited together for you. :D\n* 6/16. [House of the Dragon S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN2H_sKcmGw) (HBO/Max)\n* 6/23. [Orphan Black: Echoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QqOkpu9_tg) (AMC/BBC America/AMC+)\n* July. Bluey Minisodes (Disney+)\n* 7/18. [Cobra Kai S6 Part 1 (of 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUGgxf3tx8) (Netflix). Part 2 in November; Part 3 in 2025. Final season.\n* 7/21. *Snowpiercer* S4 (AMC/AMC+). At freakin' last. Here come the Agents of SHIELD guys. :) Clark Gregg is pulled in by the new showrunner, [Paul Zbyszewsk](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1033788/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)i.\u00a0\n* 7/29. *Futurama* S12 (Hulu)\n* 8/1. *Batman: Caped Crusader* (Amazon Prime). Another at last. The return of Bruce Timm to the Timmverse.\n* 8/8. *Umbrella Academy S4* (Netflix). Final season.\n* 8/27. [Only Murders in the Building S4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUy1FxTBUno) (Hulu)\n* 8/28. [LotR: RoP S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCwmXY_f-e0) (Amazon Prime).\n\nAFAIK, *The Ark S2* is also supposed to be airing on SyFy in the summer, but you gotta be a Dean Devlin / Jonathan Glassner fan for that one. :D",

Even after all the time, he just wanted Lois to acknowledge the pain of growing up with that kind of environment and an apology, but instead of this 'revelatory moment that changes everything' it just felt hollow instead. That episode stood out to me in particular, as Ive gone through that exact experience, so seeing that growth and change from both sides play out instead of having Lois/Francis relationship flanderized into something else was really nice to see. \n\nTouching on that though, it was nice to see growth throughout the course of a sitcom - especially for how old it is. When Jamie came along, I expected it to take a turn for the worse, but instead the trio matured and stepped up to help with the situation instead of it just turning into a way to flanderize them. Again - refreshing to see. It did start to feel a little bit stale at the end of the last season, but it never overstayed its welcome. \n\n\nWalter White is dead to me, Long live Hal",

Brilliant crime show from Ireland that started in 2010. Kind of an Irish, The Wire or Gomorrah.  Lots of familiar faces with Aidan Gillen, Charlie Murphy, Ruth Negga, and a young Barry Keoghan being immediately noticeable.  The character of Fran may be my favorite. One of the best series of the genre in my opinion. \n\nAlso **Dark Matter**, **Under the Bridge**, and **Shetland S8**",

Friends to lovers, \"I will teach you how to seduce people that are not me\", secret identities, glow-ups... but it's not working. The other subplots are boring (Francesca and Cressida are OK but not enough to carry the rest of the ensemble), one of the romantic leads can't act (ahemColin) and all in all, probably I won't watch the second part.

            "body": "# Watching\n\n**Dark Matter** - Entertaining enough that I'd suggest anyone who might like this type of Sci-Fi show give it a shot. I read the book just a week before the series started by coincidence so it's a bit difficult to rate it independently of the book. Based on the number of episodes out now 4/9, things should start getting pretty insane in the next 1 or 2 episodes and if executed properly I imagine the series will be well received.\n\n**12 Monkeys -** Came across this as a suggestion of what to watch when searching for suggestions on Reddit. Having heard little about it before it didn't interest me until I read some very favorable reviews on Reddit. Additionally with the movie being one of my all time favorite movies and perhaps it being probably the best time travel movie ever made I didn't feel a need to revisit the story in a serialized format. I mean the movie is so great its well worth revisiting every few years. I just watched it a few months ago and I'm unsure how many times I've seen it in the course of my life. 5 times? 6 times? 9 times? Maybe even 10? But the rave reviews got me to give it a chance and while the show starts with a familiar premise - its a complete reboot of the movie with an almost entirely new story. I'm only on the beginning of Season 2 but it's already introduced so many more main characters and deviations from the movie's story its impossible it for it to undo those changes (although unlike the movie, in the tv series not everything is a closed loop, so the past can be changed to rewrite the future, but writers are keeping things mysterious. Along with seeing instances where the past can be changed to rewrite the future, the viewers also see they can only alter some events slightly despite their best efforts to stop them, making the viewers ask if something such as fate does exist. The viewers also see many instances of closed loop time travel, which all add together to create a very mysterious yet very understandable (at least in terms of following the events in the show) framework for time travel. I'd recommend it to any Sci-Fi fan.\n\n# Watched\n\n**Severance** - Not sure why I waited so long to watch this series as I heard such good things about it when it came out. Maybe because it just seemed kind of bland (though I don't think I ever watched a trailer). **Great show, would recommend to all.**\n\n**The Three Body Problem** - Great show. I'd been recommended the book before many times as a big sci-fi fan and as someone who used to work at a particle accelerator. I didn't realize there was a trilogy (I think?) or at least a sequel so I thought the story would just be a one season arc but it's not. **I'd recommend to all.**\n\n**Dead Boy Detectives -** I put this show on knowing nothing about it thinking it looked stupid and that I would turn it off after a few minutes. I kept watching at first cause the main characters seemed like a couple rather than best friends so I wanted to see if I was right about that - however as I kept watching by the second episode I was becoming enthralled by the production values, acting, cast of characters (worth watching just to see Lukas Gage as the cat king), numerous queer characters, and other aspects of the show. I was thinking this show is better than it has any right to be but then I looked it up and found that Neil Gaiman created the characters and was an executive producer on the show and it made sense to me. I honestly did not get why people liked his book \"American Gods\" (and the tv adaption was bad) - but despite that I know he's a very popular author whether I enjoy all his works or not. I **loved** this show but I recognize its not for everybody as many folks aren't into the supernatural horror genre. But **I would highly recommend it to anyone who like series that broadly fall into that category, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Charmed, Shadow and Bone, The Magicians, Sabrina (Netflix) etc. Also anybody who likes/wants/or needs to see more series with queer (LGB) main characters.**\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nAlways looking for suggestions of what to watch next, so feel free to share some with me if you think its something I may enjoy!\n\nAlso, how do people track the tv shows and movies they watch? Many suggestions are for one or the other, like letterboxed for movies. Seems there should be a good service for both, or is it just better to use two separate services? Hit me with your suggestions please!",

Iron Man Crashed into the Grandmaster?\" frustrating as the character interactions and tension was good and interesting but the episode had the issue that some MCU content does where it kept inserting jokes in in a way where it undercut the emotional moments...\n\nFinale was good although I think this continues to pile on to the MCU issue of >!undercutting Infinity War/Endgame by having even more infinity stones show up and not be the end all, be all.!< Interested to see what they do with season 3. Please though Marvel be more careful with when and where you place your jokes. I'm not against comedy in Marvel but don't undercut dramatic moments with jokes.",

Even if you aren't a huge Star Wars fan, it really has some artistic merit.

Little by little things start spinning out of control as past sins are brought up to light and they question how much is the truth actually worth to uncover. Pretty good series.

Her 2021 keeps changing as she changes the past, but she's determined to save this young man, even if it erases her existence. \n\nReally enjoying it.",

Lee Pace and Jared Harris are always good, and the Empire storyline while not as strong as S1 is still fascinating.\n\nCons: parts of it really felt more like \"they did this because it's a tv show\" as opposed to just trying to tell an epic story.  Example: the \"drunk and a monk\" episode where they introduce these two characters doing rather silly things completely feels like a TV trope, though later they are treated more seriously.  The Hober Mallow character also felt like a complete trope (roguish, charming, good at everything he does and keeps fooling the authorities in power.  Basically Robin Hood without the noble background) and so felt like a character made for a TV show as opposed to an actual person in a story.  I also didn't care much for the Dominion Queen storyline.  The Gaal character still seems quite insufferable and I dislike her quite a bit.",

Shorter season (26 days) and new advantages/twists that seem to hurt the overall game, but I still find it enjoyable. 44 is good but I feel like I enjoyed 45 more, may be recency bias. 45 has a truly hilarious and bewildering first few episodes and a transition into some great gameplay. A satisfying season with a likeable cast.\n\nI have to say though, season 46 just finished and it was wildly entertaining for all of the wrong reasons. The cast doesn\u2019t all come across as superfan gamebots and overall they seem much less concerned with how they\u2019ll be perceived in their edits. I cringed, I laughed, I cried, I yelled at the tv. If you want a less serious season full of chaos, check it out.\n\nAll of that to say - I\u2019d skip both 45 and 46 and go straight to Australian Survivor season 5 and continue from there if I had access. They blow the new era seasons of Survivor out of the water. Much longer seasons, less fluff, fresh challenges, great casts, and twists that enhance the game instead of hindering the players.",

And while 46 just ended, lots of us are of the opinion that it's handily the best season of the new era.\n\nAlso, ***Australian Survivor*** has been straight up incredible. I've only seen *Brains vs. Brawn*, *Heroes vs. Villains*, and most recently *Titans v Rebels*, with the latter ending a few months ago. I would highly recommend watching BvB before HvV, as they're basically two halves of the same story. And TvR is pretty much a perfect all-newbies cast.",

Even though the seasons usually are a year with fall and winter in the first half, any great show set in California is a spring/summer comfort watch to me as a michigander. Sterling K Brown is genuinely one of the best to ever do it. The non-linear storytelling is so well-done; even the young child and teen actors are excellent and the dynamics are so layered. I know some people trash on it for being trauma porn, emotionally manipulative, or tv made to cry to but I heavily disagree and will forever love it. I don\u2019t understand how really depressing stuff that is about shitty people and gory never gets slapped with that label yet shows about genuinely decent people who go through a lot do. Maybe it\u2019s because people may care more if something happens to them because they are decent but it\u2019s undeserved in my opinion, especially since it\u2019s more believable because the things that do happen are relatively common and the show takes place over a huge timeline; it shows the most emotional vignettes of a life but I don\u2019t think emotional potency is manipulative. \n\nMarlon Season 2 - Very funny and canceled far too early; I finished it first week of April and already am rewatching the two seasons. It is carried by his acting and timing but the writing is really good. Even though it may be blasphemous to say I honestly prefer it to the wayans bros. \n\nGrace and Frankie Season 2 - my generation\u2019s golden girls (if they kept the queer main characters) and God is it a delight! It\u2019s so fun to actually see a friendship developing when so many sitcoms start with lifelong friends and settled dynamics; I didn\u2019t know how much I longed to see that. The cast is so ridiculously stacked it boggles my mind. \n\nTwo Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place Season 1 - this started as a nostalgic watch that I expected to grow off me but it\u2019s genuinely really good. I found it similar to baby daddy in quality and character dynamics though there is no child. Even though I loved castle right after seeing this as a kid I never registered that it was Nathan Fillon in this so I\u2019m excited for Season 2.",

The Netflix Tudum (press) site, also has [a series of press releases on Eric](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/eric).\n\nIt's possibly not as strong or coherent as *The Hour* or *River* (which is the closest-related piece and is up on Freevee and Britbox at the moment)*,* but it's still damn good (say, on a par with *The Split*, which, btw, [Morgan's apparently going to revisit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2024/the-split-returns-for-two-part-special)).  But it's also significantly more ambitious.\n\nAnd if it's a little weird for a UK tv writer to do something set so specifically in '80s NYC, it's because Morgan actually worked there at the time as a nanny. It doesn't bullseye *all* of its many targets  (systemic racism, homelessness, homophobia, government corruption, etc. etc.) or hit quite the same emotional connections as *River*. But for me, it still worked gangbusters. And I'd far rather watch a series that swings for the fences and misses by a hair than something that doesn't take any risks at all and has nothing to say. Also, I was a teen in the '80s and a massive Henson fan, so some things possibly hit a little differently for me than they might for a younger non-Henson-fan viewer. :)",
