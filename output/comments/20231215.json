They always have mature experienced actors portraying gripping characters with lots of depth, and then younger and inexperienced ones in frustratingly naive and shallow roles.  I don't know if its a problem with writing or casting, but Monarch, Foundation, and For All Mankind all have this problem.  \n\nAnd its not really isolated to the first season where characters are being fleshed out, Foundation simply had better and more significant plot-lines for it's mature leads in season 2, while Gale remained it's weakest yet prominent link.  For All Mankind also continues to lean on it's S1 superstar characters that are now aging into retirement.  \n\nIt's a really peculiar thing that a company at the forefront of teenage digital life struggles to create scifi with relatable younger characters.  Footballers in Ted Lasso is the closest they have come to pulling it off outside of scifi, however even there the writing only got weaker as it progressed further into their lives.",

He's playing a character, but leans into the mystery of blurring reality and fiction. There's obviously production going on behind the scenes so it's hard to say for sure how much is staged. Check out \"The Rehearsal\" when you finish Nathan for You, where he goes to the next level leaning into the \"is this real? does it even matter if it's real or not?\" meta commentary",

Strictly as a whodunnit, it's okay I guess but mostly just bland. The episode one premise is great, and then they invest so little into fleshing out most of the characters that I barely remember why they are even there in the first place.\n\nThe one thought I can't get over, and I don't consider this a spoiler, is why make Darby a hacker??? Her backstory for being a good sleuth/detective who is resourceful is great and makes perfect sense. And then it's like, \"oh yeah, she's a hacker too btw\". Like at no point do they explain how she actually developed these skills other than she used to idolize a prominent female hacker. I can only think of three specific instances of where she uses her hacking \"abilities\" in the show. The first one isn't even necessary, and she is sitting beside someone who is supposed to be a way better hacker than her anyway. The second is the only legitimate use of it. The third, she is again with another way more experienced hacker. They could have so easily written out that aspect of her character and it would still make perfect sense and I'd argue her solutions to the problems she faces would be significantly more interesting then, \"Yay, I hacked it\".\n\nAnd what makes the hacking thing even worse is she isn't even that good of a detective in the present day events. Pretty much everything she deduces she does so with the power of observation (i.e., she literally sees it happening) or it's just plain dumb luck, but okay whatever. The flashback backstory of Darby and Bill is significantly more interesting and gripping than the main events of the show in my opinion. The four characters they actually do develop are pretty interesting. I guess if you're really desperate for a whodunnit where they only focus on half of the characters then it's worth a watch, but man I would be surprised if this show doesn't get lost in time real quick.",

Using the bluetooth speakers to simulate the door knock when getting invited via AR and the different bit combinations when trying to hack the garage doors using a toy.

I think I prefer Reacher as a character when those around him aren't also badass semi sherlock types. Given I'm a dad I'll obviously continue to watch it. But the first 3 episodes haven't grabbed me like the first season.\n\n**The Curse -** *This show*. I watched the first episode and the ongoing sense of dread and anxiety put me off it, but then I watched 3 more episodes last night and I'm hooked. It's unlike anything else on television and I have no idea where it is going. It's odd to see Fielder act against the likes of Stone but it largely works.\n\n**The Bear** \\- Almost done with the first season. Despite the hype and love it hasn't grabbed me like most others. I don't like any of the characters (besides the baker) and it seems to operate in this weird space between realism and surrealism which is jarring. I appreciate the episodes are only 25-30 mins and they are well shot.\n\n**Fargo** \\- Having only watched an episode here and there of previous seasons I didn't know really what to expect. I can't wait to watch a new episode week to week. Everyone on this show is fantastic and it looks great. I didn't know I wanted a home alone television show. But here we are.\n\n**Slow Horses** \\- Good to see it getting some love in this sub. I'm a big fan of the books and the show translates them very well to screen, making clever narrative and character changes along the way that make me second guess what I have read and anticipate. Oldman is great of course but so is Jack Lowden who plays River Cartwright and hopefully this gets renewed for season 5 and beyond as I can't wait to see certain characters pop up.",

Perfect balance between the horror and the mental illness that lets the creators have a lot of fun with the story. The characters in this one are also just a ton of fun. Pity absolutely nobody watches anything on Starz! \n\n**Godfather of Harlem** - I\u2019ve been rewatching the first season so I can finally jump onto the second and third seasons. Just as fantastic as I remembered. Great show and great cast and even a great intro! I\u2019m sure this would be a real awards contender if it was not an Epix show! As expected Forest Whitaker, Giancarlo Esposito, and Vincent D'Onofrio are excellent in their roles but the standout performance might be that of Nig\u00e9l Thatch as Malcom X. Great gangster drama that benefits from the Civil Rights movement of the time playing out in the background. \n\nNext up more **Godfather of Harlem**! After that I need to binge through some more shows on Lionsgate+ in the U.K. before the service is permanently closed early in 2024 leaving all its show without a home in the UK.

Just six episodes so far too.  The two main characters are fun to hang around with, and have great \"buddy movie\" chemistry.

Not hitting with the same oomph as other Fielder work. The awkwardness just isn't hitting its mark. Also, it's like Uncanny Valley in an abstract non-human-look sense, idk how to explain it-doesn't quite convince me enough to suspend my disbelief.\n\nGoosebumps was decent, better than I expected.\n\nDoom Patrol end was a good wrap up for a really wacky show.\n\nJulia new season is pretty good.\n\nFargo new season is decent to pretty good. Don't like it as much of the other seasons, and this Rambo plot centers everything on one character vs a much more even ensemble cast/characters in other seasons. It also removes some of the bad luck/good luck shit happens coin flip charm that previous scenarios had. Feels the most out of character for what, to me, Fargo is (very) loosely based around. The interplay between the main character and her mil is by the most fun thing about this season. I'm still enjoying it, bad Fargo is pretty good compared to most everything else, really.\n\nThe Lazarus Project is good.\n\nBeacon 23 is good. Should get a lot more mention than it does here.\n\nFor All Mankind new season is pretty good.\n\nHullraisers is pretty good.\n\nLoki season 2 was pretty good.\n\nCulprits is pretty good.\n\nLawmen: Bass Reeves is pretty bad to decent. Feels low quality for such an accomplished person.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai is very good. I'm going to nitpick and say that the Japanese quickly adopted the matchlock when introduced to them and by the time of these events it would have been mass produced, so the plot sticking point is complete BS. Suspend your disbelief here because it's very good regardless.\n\nInvincible new season is good, but how easy it was to forgive and forget feels forced. And this 4 episodes on 4 off thing is horrible torture, but maybe it releases the pressure on the artists (heh, who am I kidding, it's probably only beneficial to the higher ups)...\n\nScavengers Reign is great.

Underrated show imo.\n\nBodies was decent to pretty good.\n\nPantheon new season was good.\n\nShining Vale is good to very good. I originally overlooked this but gave it a shot. Another underrated show imo.\n\nLessons in Chemistry was pretty good.\n\nReacher new season is pretty good, worse than the first imo. Plot seems rushed and the side characters feel a lot more like background characters than in the first season. They're like satellite mini-mes of Reacher, I know they have distinct traits but they feel like they don't whereas the previous season's side characters were more indepedent. Idk, can't articulate it...\n\nThe Fall of the House of Usher was good.\n\nEDIT: Forgot-\n\nFisk is good to very good. Australian comedy about a solicitor/office. Saw it suggested here and it's a lot of fun.\n\nOh, and the Bear s2 deserves the high praise. Even better than the 1st.",

(Especially if someone is a huge fan of time travel and time loop SciFi, as I do--I'm pretty obsessed with that theme.) \n\nI'm surprised its IMDB rating isn't higher. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nI also agree with you that Upload is very underrated. \n\nIt's not a deep artistic incredible SciFi. \n\nIt's a lot more comedic and half serious, with some slapstick style moments. But... overall... it's just really fun, and good. \n\nIt reminds me a lot of Avenue 5--similar half serious, comedic SciFi. So if you haven't seen Avenue 5 yet, and you enjoyed Upload, then you'll probably have fun watching Avenue 5 as well. (Avenue 5 isn't quite as good, but still fun.) \n\n--------------------------------\n\nAs for Beacon 23, I thought that title looked familiar... \n\nAnd then it hit me: I read that short story years ago--I think it was in one of those \"Years Best SciFi Short Stories\" collections, and loved it! \n\nSo ya, I can't believe it's a TV show... thanks for mentioning it! \n\nI know what I'm watching today with my GF! \n\nI just saw the IMDB rating is low though at 5.5, which is surprising because the short story was so good.

OTOH, Miriam Margolyes is getting a lot of voice work between this and the Meep on *Doctor Who.* :D\n\n***Mr. Monk's Last Case*** (Peacock). Of course covid would have pushed Monk over the OCD edge. I loved how character-driven this piece was, and how it was a nice reunion of the whole gang getting back together again. Shalhoub is a treasure.  A nice little coda to the series.\n\n***Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials*** (Disney+). I am so happy RTD is back. I loved \"The Giggle\". NPH getting to show off his NPHness (between this and *It's a Sin,* I think RTD has pulled out his considerable, entire range). >!Ncuti Gatwa getting to do his first stint as the Doctor while not wearing any trousers.!< Also that this was clearly a backdoor pilot for [the UNIT spinoff](https://www.cbr.com/doctor-who-unit-spinoff-kate-stewart/). :) I am so looking forward to the new season. And I'm so ticked off Disney+ didn't bother to snag *Doctor Who Unleashed* (behind-the-scenes episodes) or the commentary tracks on \"Star Beast\" and \"The Giggle\". I have mashed their \"Submit Feedback\" button on [the content suggestion page](https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-content-suggestion).\n\n***The Crown S6B*** (Netflix). Loved it. A perfect closer. I don't care what anyone else says, I loved the ghost/spirit conversations and particularly that >!we got to see all three Queens in one shot!<. I'm also loving how most of S6 has included contrapuntal/B-sides of stuff we didn't see/explore in *The Queen* and [*The Special Relationship*](https://play.max.com/movie/25ee712f-6b53-4189-9f54-b11e7444809b). Also still very weird not to see Michael Sheen playing Blair in a Morgan-written piece :), but Bertie Carvel did an amazing job.  I can't wait to see what Morgan writes next.\n\n***Julia*** s2 (Max). Continues to make me sooooo happy every week. I loved that this week Paul got to shine solo as he fixed everyone around him and then turned the tables with Julia on their enemy at the end of the episode.  I'm sad next week is the finale.\n\n***The Gilded Age*** (Max). Also penultimate episode of the season. Not as soul-nourishing as *Julia* has been, but still great fun, particularly with all the Broadway actors in the cast. And they've definitely given Baranski some stuff to play for the upcoming finale.\n\n***Reacher S2*** (Amazon Prime). The first three episodes dropped and it's as fun as Season 1. I can see why they skipped to the eleventh book if we get to see Reacher work in a team, rather than solo. Should be a good season, even if y'all are gonna have to wait a week between episodes. I still watch broadcast, so I'm fine with it.\n\n***Obliterated*** (Netflix). Since it's by the *Cobra Kai* guys, I thought I'd give it a shot, but I just couldn't get into it.  Too empty-calorie sex/violence  viewing for me, and I tend in general to be humor impaired, particularly when it's rude humor. YMMV.\n\nUpcoming for me:\n\n* 12/17. [*Archer: Into the Cold*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sao_AHtZz4I) (FXX / Hulu). The \"supersize\" finale.\n* 12/20. [*Percy Jackson and the Olympians*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHb7au6Gmls) (Disney+) Showrun by *Black Sails* folks.\n* 12/22. [*What If...? S2*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiEVqZ2Bc_c) (Disney+). I note one of the episodes looks to be playing in [Gaiman's *1602* sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_1602).\n* 12/24. [*Spirited Away: Live on Stage*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED5Y8mz8P8g) (Max)\n* 12/25. [*Doctor Who:* \"The Church on Ruby Road\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB87uGgoKBg) (Disney+)\n* 12/25. *Star Trek: Prodigy S1* (Netflix drop). For the Paramount+ less among you. Showrunners Kevin and Dan Hageman were the story guys on *Trollhunters,* and Aaron J. Waltke and Chad Quandt were also in the *Trollhunters* writers room. IOW, if you liked *Trollhunters,* you might like *Prodigy* and vice versa.\n* 1/4. [*The Brothers Sun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU8f8QrUCOM) (Netflix).

We didn't get enough of how it got so bad for her in the day to day activities to have something of this magnitude this happen to her.!<\n\nStarted **How I Met Your Father** and initially didn't see why it was so disliked, apart from the too-quirky adopted sister, the Brit who seemed to be in a different show and the mom's cringey oversharing in the opening monologues. The second season's early eps made the issues crystal clear - such a drop off in quality.\n\nHappy that I came across old eps of **Famalam**, a Brit sketch show, on Prime.

A good-natured story about some kids who traveled across the US on their bikes in 1982, to raise awareness for MS. But mostly for the adventure. The kids, now adults, express how much of an impact this experience had on them. It reminded me of my own experience with El Camino de Santiago, here in Spain. There's a deep allegorical power in these types of experiences, sharing a similar path and destination with other people, the bonds that are created, etc.\n\nWatched the first episode of **Carol and the end of the World**, which was ok. But it felt a little like they just had a couple of interesting ideas and just ran with them. Too soon for me to tell. It's got dry & dark humor to it, a bit edgy too.

I was very engaged at first, found it even brilliant at times but after episode 6 (which is by far the best episode of this show) it takes a big nosedive. All of a sudden a random girl shows up and introduces a whole new set of characters that are completely dull and you simply can't care about(exception is Stephen Fry). Actors that portray them are emotionless and wooden which makes em more drab. David Thewlis' storyline on the other hand is quite interesting filled with philosophical as well as human nature questions of what drives us. The Sandman as a character was interesting in this part as well fighting his own inner and outer battles. I still think it's worth watching for first 6 episodes at least, after that you can figure out for yourself if you want to finish it but honestly you won't miss much..\n\nLoki - season 2. This is hands down the best season of any superhero tv show ever. Character progression throughout this show is something dramas would be jealous of. I won't go further than this, just watch it!",

I was onboard for the concept and think more shows should have protags who are middle aged women. Still I didn't actually laugh until like the 10 minute of the third episode. The protagonist is kind of hard to root for. I could empathize with someone who eschews all the over-achievers and extroverts of the world but I guess I do want to hear more of the main's point of view articulated. Even if she doesn't talk to other people maybe have a conceit where she keeps a diary or something. Otherwise it is just frustrating for the audience. Maybe that was by design but yeah I'm about to give up on this one. \n\nAlso, end of the world scenarios don't seem all that well suited to a character finding themselves. Especially where all there basic life needs seem to be met. Zom 100 had a character who found himself while fighting for his survival and food and such. In this there always seems to be enough resources and yet no one outside her account department and national guard at the grocery seems to working (oh and the ship captain). Where is gas coming from? Electricity? Who is growing that food? The world actually does need a labor force. \n\nThe show is weirdly laudatory of the virtues of the workplace and routine. I guess that is an interesting point to make and think about but it also probably won't play well in age of anti-work. I can see virtues on both sides of the argument (work can provide stability but it can also be exploitive and there should be less of it) but I would imagine the concept will be a turn off to many people here.",
