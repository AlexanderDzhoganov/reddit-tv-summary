Since that is one of my favorite books of all time I immediately checked this out. It\u2019s got great character depth, outstanding performances, it\u2019s well paced, and it excels in capturing the historical context and setting of the times. \n\n\n* The Resort - This is a compelling mystery with another great ensemble cast that has some surprising plot twists to keep you guessing.",

I was intrigued the first time watching it but I kept dozing off so I put it on hold. I came back to the show a couple days ago and started over and easily binged-watched the whole thing. What an incredible season finale.  Too bad it might be awhile before we see S2.\n\nI loved the unique blend of dystopian sci-fi, existential angst, and workplace comedy. The music was particularly outstanding. It makes me want to watch Ben Stiller's other seriously directed works like Escape at Dannemora.\n\n**Lessons in Chemistry S1 Episode 4  (Apple TV)**  \\-- This is really becoming another standout show for Apple TV. Episode four might be my favorite so far.\n\nAs a film buff, I'm loving how the series occasionally uses unconventional narrative techniques to tell its story, similar to Netflix's *The Queen's Gambit*.\n\nLast week, the episode opened up with a very unusual and unexpected narrator, retelling some events in a way you don't normally see. In this week's episode, time jumps are used very creatively, but not just moving forward and back in time, but also moving in subjective time as events in the real world are superimposed by what the main character is feeling at the time, almost like hallucinations.\n\nThere's also a very neat twist at the end of this episode that answers a question that I didn't even know was there. This was total surprise and had me laughing.\n\nAnyway, I hope the show gains more popularity even with fans who wouldn't normally see this kind of show. A very charming story, and if you're looking for something just a tad unusual, and told in a very creative way, check it out.",

I avoided these shows because the hive mind was so abuzz with how good they were and I was all, \"Ugh, network television - no thank you.\"\n\nI started My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and while I immediately got the charm and appeal of this show, it's not one I can sit and binge for hours.  Smaller doses of this romantic/comedy/musical are best for me, but I enjoy it so much.\n\nI particularly enjoy the best bud and senior paralegal, Paula played by Donna Lynne Champlin.  As a senior paralegal working for a small firm myself - I identified with Paula - BIG TIME.  Especially when she was left in charge for a day and went around setting everyone straight.  I think I replayed that scene four or five times and it wasn't even one of the hilarious musical numbers.\n\nSo if you've avoided a show - any kind of show, not just a sitcom because it's popular or you aren't sure it appeals to you, I encourage you to give that show a try.

I loved the Stormfront season of the Boys (S2?), but when the newest season came out, I watched the first episode and was like\u2026 Oh I am NOT in the headspace for this show right now, lol. Watching the first few episodes of Gen V made me want to catch up on s3 of the Boys, so I ended up binging it in a few days waiting for new episodes of Gen V. \n\nWhere the Boys satirizes politics, media, etc in a more macro sense, Gen V feels more micro focused on topics geared toward younger audiences. I think as a whole, I prefer the Boys to Gen V at this point - but both are enjoyable watches. \n\n**Lessons in Chemistry**\n\nI absolutely love this show. It\u2019s interesting and heartfelt. It does an excellent job portraying \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d, both in the time period it\u2019s set and how they are still relevant now. As a woman who is at that cross-roads in life where I am having to somewhat choose between focusing my career vs having babies, it really hits home. Brie Larson is very charismatic in the role. This is my favourite weekly show right now. \n \n**Loki**\nSeason 2\n\nI had really fallen off the MCU bandwagon, but Loki S2 has made me actually want to catch up with the new instalments when I have the time. So kudos for that! I think the last MCU movie that I watched was Shang-Chi/Eternals and the last show was\u2026 Loki S1? Not sure if I\u2019ll catch up with all the new shows, but I\u2019ll probably catch up with the movies\u2026 eventually. Tom Hiddleston is still delightful to watch, but my favourite is Ke Huy Quan. Extra disappointing that Jonathan Majors evidently sucks in real life, because I enjoy him a lot in the role. \n\nBinged: \n**Fall of the House of Usher** \n\nI love all of Mike Flanagan\u2019s work and this was no exception. The tone was very different to what I was expecting from Midnight Mass/Hill House/Bly Manor though. It was an enjoyable binge for sure, but it\u2019s somewhat forgettable compared to Hill House/Midnight Mass in my opinion. I would definitely rank Hill House/Midnight Mass above it. Enjoyable, but not ground-breaking television. \n\n**One-Piece Live Action**\n\nI put this on because it had gotten good reviews and I just wanted something low-key to watch, but oh man, I fell in love! I am totally new to the One Piece world and I really enjoyed the tone of this, it\u2019s very campy/fun but there\u2019s also a bit of an edge to it that makes it feel adult-oriented. I fell in love mainly due to Luffy\u2019s character. He is a difficult character to pull off and feel genuinely authentic, but his actor did an incredible job!! \n\nAfter finishing the LA, I tried watching the anime\u2026 but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m quite as into it? Luffy punching/making fun of Koby in the first episode of the anime made me sad, lol. And I\u2019m not super into the art style. I also didn\u2019t realize there\u2019s like 1000+ episodes to catch up on\u2026 that\u2019s a big commitment. Unless I run into a ton of free time - I might just stay a LA fan, unfortunately. \n\nIn Progress:\n**Attack on Titan**\n\nPrior to watching One-Piece, I hadn\u2019t watched any anime in years! I had binged season 1 of AoT years ago and loved it, then watched season 2 on weekly release. I kept up with the first few episodes of season 3 weekly, but life got busy I guess, and I didn\u2019t keep going. \nI\u2019m now rewatching from season 1 and enjoying it a ton! I still remember the big s1/s2 \u201ctwists\u201d, so I can\u2019t wait to get to the new (to me) seasons, but I definitely needed the refresh to fully appreciate it. \n\nRecommendations: \nAny recommendations on what to watch once I\u2019m finished AoT? I\u2019ve read good things about Steins;Gate, so I think I\u2019ll try that next. \n\nAlso, does anyone happen to know when/if there\u2019s a Canadian release date for Scavengers Reign? I assume it\u2019ll be on Crave, but I haven\u2019t seen anything about when.",

It's the long-awaited adaptation of Naoki Urasawa's manga. He's considered one of the more revered mangakas in Japan. I haven't seen it yet, but I've read his mangas and really enjoyed them. \n\nNetflix also has **Monster**, which is older anime-adaption of one of his other mangas but it's considered a classic. \n\n**Cyperpunk 2077**, despite based on a videogame, is made by a Japanese anime studio and it's good. \n\nI've only partially read Steins; Gate the visual novel and haven't seen the anime, but I often recommend **Death Note** to Attack on Titan fans. It's a totally different show but the plot is really good with a lot of devious twists, and it features smart character. Watch the anime, not the live-action version.  This anime was also mega-popular like Attack on Titan. \n\n**Evangelion** was arguably even more popular than Attack on Titan in Japan when it originally came out.   It's an older anime but it's a must-see, as long as you don't mind anti-heroes in a sci-fi setting. I \n\n**Cowboy Bebop** and **Trigun** are really good and have a big following. They both have a sci-fi/western which make them unique. \n\n**Spy x Family** is a newer anime, if you want something more upbeat and popular. It's on Hulu in the US.",

Jake Lacy was great as B, moving fluidly between affable and sinister. It was great and comforting as well seeing the real Jan in a small part toward the end. After watching this, I need to get my act together and watch *Candy* as well\r  \n\r  \n**Scott & Bailey:** Nicola Walker... Her performance in s3 was incredible. Absolutely incredible. Anyway, I enjoyed this show a lot more than anticipated. Especially considering the breakneck speed at which character beats moved (with developments often taking place off screen, even). It's not my thing usually, but somehow it works. The last season was a bit too short, unsatisfying and underdeveloped (and I really didn't like the Taisie plot), but other than that... Good stuff. I'm gonna miss watching this\r  \n\r  \n*Binging*\r  \n\r  \n**Poker Face:** I thought it started decent enough, but episode two had me *hooked*. This is the perfect vehicle for NL's particular brand of charm and the show nails the quirky tone and idiosyncratic characters. And as I'm so sick of stories that sacrifice logic, character, and plot for the sake of shocking twists, I love that we start each episode learning how the murder happened and then get to see how Charlie fits into the whole thing. The storytelling structure is really refreshing\r  \n\r  \n**The Fall of House Usher**: not had time to watch more\r\r  \n\r  \n**Why Women Kill s2:** this is perfect for my mood right now so the other shows I binge will be put on hold for now so I can burn through this",

I particularly love how they are intertwining the two shows. (The Boys)\n\n**Shows while Working**\n\n* *Invincible (Episode 5)*\n   * I'm not a big fan of animation but this show has grabbed my attention. Would love if this got a live action rendition.\n* *All American (S.4, Ep. 9)*\n   * Very easy watch but it's not that great. They just recycle the same tropes over and over. I'll keep watching though to see if it gets better. This show is nowhere near Friday Night Lights\n* *Our Flag Means Death (S.1, Ep. 9)*\n   * Took me a while to get into this show but I'm enjoying it. It has an interesting set of characters. Loved the Will Arnett cameo. Excited to see where this story goes. \n* *Billions (S.7, Ep. 4)*\n   * This is one of those shows that just went on too long. 4-5 seasons would have been perfect. I absolutely will finish it but I miss those first few seasons a lot.\n* *The Pacific (Ep. 3)*\n   * I loved Band of Brothers so not sure why it took me this long to start this show but it's been really good, but obviously very sad. Need more Bernthal though. And I think Rami shows up too at some point?\n* *Reservation Dogs (S.1, Ep. 6)*\n   * This show is hilarious. Nothing more needs to be said. Big is phenomenal.\n* *Justified: City Primeval (Ep. 2)*\n   * Well, I'm glad to see Raylan back but this show is a complete 180 from Justified. Nothing wrong with that but I highly doubt it will be nearly as good. \n* *Slow Horses (S.2, Ep. 2)*\n   * The first season was good but I wasn't blown away. Interested where this new season is going. Gary Oldman is quite funny in it.\n\n**Shows With My Girlfriend**\n\n* *Masterchef (S.13, Ep.20)*\n   * We are on the finale and this season has been solid. But if the winner is who I think it will be, it's been predictable since the first episode. I'd love to see a masterchef season where there's a point system.\n* *Bodies (Ep. 2)*\n   * Watched the first episode of this and am a mix of intrigued and completely clueless of what this show is even about. We'll see what they do with this. \n* *The Bear (S.2 rewatch)*\n   * This show is so special. Maybe the best character development currently on tv.",

On the one hand she is trying to discover (and deal with) the real world; and on the other hand she is trying to enact revenge on the people who hurt her family in the past.\n\nI know what you are saying: that is the exact same premise as *Hannah*. And it is, in a way. But it is used here for a dark yet farcical comedy. \n\nThe show has a number of flaws, including glaring plot holes. But I still think it is worth a watch, expecially because the cast is great and they are obviously having a blast. Just switch your brain off for this one.",

The Traitors has a lot of good things going for it - specifically the time frame, as it seems like they shoot the entire show over the course of 1-2 weeks.  Players also aren't living together, which is an interesting choice but ultimately works out well for this.  \n\nThe show/format is definitely missing something though.  If it goes through a few evolutions it might be a really great setup (from what I've seen of all of UK and part of Canada, though, right now they are probably just all copying the exact format of whatever the original one was).  They need to add a little bit more depth to the game, especially on the traitor's side.",

If the show continues to gain popularity, the creator hopes to do eight seasons.\n\n**For All Mankind** \\-- made by the same person who did the Battlestar Galactica reboot, so I think you'll like this too.\n\nWhile the sci-fi aspect is initially retro, since the show begins in the 1960s, every season jumps a decade and you see how this alternate timeline of Earth, where the Space Race never abated, starts to really diverge from our timeline and it steadily gets more futuristic, even though season four, which is about to air soon, is set in the 2000s. So even though it's still set in the past, the attempts to colonize space has led to more technological advances than in our timeline. In some ways, it feels like a precursor to The Expanse even though this are two totally separate shows.\n\n**Silo** \\-- post-apocalyptic show based on the popular books by Hugh Howey. I liked this too.\n\n**Severance** \\-- a weird blend of workplace comedy, sci-fi, existential angst, and other disparate elements that make for one really odd but great show. It starts out slow but the final two episodes are some of the best TV I've seen in a long while.  If you like mind-bendy stuff, then you'll probably like this too.\n\n**Monarch: Legacy of Monsters** \\-- new Godizlla & friends TV show on Apple about to start soon. It'll probably be campy and cheesy but I love kaiju big monster movies so I'm looking forward to this.\n\n**Dr. Brain** \\-- a Korean TV show as some sci-fi elements, although it's set in modern-day times. I haven't seen this yet, but the director is one of my favorite Korean film directors, who directed the very haunting *A Tale of Two Sister*s and the dark noir mystery  *I Saw the Devil*.  Those are two fantastic films.\n\nFor non-Apple TV stuff try:\n\n**Dark (Netflix)** \\-- one of the best time-travel shows I've ever seen. It's a slow-burn at the start as it has to establish the huge cast, then it get crazier and crazier, with a very intricate plot. I HIGHLY recommend this and stick with it.\n\n**The Last Kingdom (Netflix)** \\-- since you said it doesn't have to be sci-fi, and if you want something more epic like BSG, don't mind historical shows, this is a super fun show involving knights and Vikings. It's like a less-grim, Game of Thrones, featuring a lot of likable characters and characters you'll love to hate. It's really underrated.  Also watch the follow-up movie that was released this year. It provides a really satisfying resolution.  A very addicting show.\n\n**Kingdom (Netflix)** \\-- not to be confused with The Last Kingdom, but if you want Game of Thrones but with zombies set in feudal Korea, check this out. Maybe that doesn't sound appealing, but you should be hooked by in the 2nd episode.\n\nOther sci-fi stuff: **Utopia (UK or US version), Orphan Black, Alice in Borderlands**.\n\nI know you said you don't like monster-of-the-week shows, but since you liked Firefly, I really recommend watching Joss Whedon's other shows like **Buffy the Vampire Killer** and the spin-off **Angel**.\n\nOnce you get past the first season, there's a bigger narrative that helps to tie the episodic plots and it explores a lot of genres and the characters really evolve and (sometimes in very unexpected ways) which is unusual for a network TV show like this from this time period.",

Guys and girls residing across the hall from one another in the big city getting into shenanigans isn't a completely unique idea. But there's an extensive history of whitewashing black art to popularize and mainstream it for a white audience, akin to the Beach Boys plagiarizing Chuck Berry. \n\nAnyway, issa fun show.\n\nIf you're into throwbacks 90s black comedy, you might enjoy [Martin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103488/).",

I remain shocked that Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi have romantic chemistry that I am genuinely invested in, and Con O\u2019Neill deserves a best supporting actor in a comedy Emmy nom.\n\nHoly shit, the pacing of this season, though. The transition from the 10 ep s1 to the 8 ep s2 is so rough, and it\u2019s a solid example of why shorter episode counts struggle for half-hour comedies. When every episode needs constant forward momentum to work toward a satisfactory ending ON TOP OF telling jokes, it makes me yearn for network sitcoms where writers feel free to write experimental episodes that have nothing to do with any planned end-goal. With the runtime it has, OFMD feels way overcomplicated by trying to juggle a dozen+ pirate characters (including redemption arcs), an overarching conflict about defending piracy from colonialism, several romances, AND comedy, all within eight half-hour chunks that often feel clunky and disjointed. Season 2 feels like it\u2019s trying to do more than season 1 did with a fraction of season 1\u2019s runtime, and it ultimately hits a lot less hard for it. \n\nI could write thousands of words about Ed and Stede alone, and I therefore totally understand why this show has a rabid fanfic-consuming fandom. Those characters have meat; however, how the show condenses or flattens their arcs to rush towards a conclusion does them a disservice. The season\u2019s ending feels so much less earned and so much more abrupt than it should be, which is so disappointing considering what a strong, thematically-cohesive finale season 1 had. I am desperate for these characters to be given more breathing room. I hope that, if it gets renewed, season 3 gets a higher episode count, but, unfortunately, considering the finality season 2 ended with I doubt it will.",

I've never seen any seasons/episodes before. I started with (what Hulu calls?) season 3, the current season. \"Bestie\" piqued my interest as something Black Mirrorish. \"Organ\" was definitely the best (so far). Idk what's up with \"Delicate\". I wasn't expecting it to be a two part. Then I realized it was a three part. Then a four part \ud83d\ude2b Pretty sure there's more STILL. I had to give it a break. It's too slow and not that good to be this many parts. Hopefully it's almost over and there will be more single episode stories.

At this point I'm wondering why it took so long... we waited like almost three years? And they are dropping only 4 episode this year and no date for the other episodes (they said next year...)\n\nIt's a really weird situation, Amazon has the money, they already have a successful comics that can last a lot of seasons and I really don't understand what is happening. I read all the comics years ago after S1, and I was hyped to see the adaptation but I've already forgot half of it at this point. I guess I'm not the only one that lost the hype.\n\nIt's also so badly advertised. Atom eve special was dropped a few weeks ago and nobody knew or saw it.",

In episode four OB is *still* worried about the loom and, *again* they\u2019re sending someone out to fix it. It doesn\u2019t work and we\u2019re supposed to be amazed that they\u2019ve destroyed everyone. But we know they haven\u2019t. That ending carries almost no dramatic weight. In episode two around three things happened: they tracked down the TVA guy living his best life as an actor, spent twenty minutes interrogating him, because for some unknown reason he was very unwilling to give up Sophie\u2019s location, but then he does, and they go talk to her in the McDonald\u2019s, explaining whatever about the loom and the timelines. Episode three was the stammering Loki variant (I\u2019m getting kind of sick of Jonathan Major\u2019s overly mannered Timely schtick) a lot of the worlds fair, Miss minutes becoming a kind of Fatal Attraction stalker of Timely so she ditches Revona, but then Revona comes back and Loki and Sophie and Mobius turn up and they all argue, and then they throw Revona to the end of time and in this episode herself and Miss Minutes are now a team again for some reason because miss minutes shows Revona that Kang didn\u2019t care about her so they go back to the TVA - super easy barely an inconvenience - try to recruit all the TVA people in TVA jail, but when they won\u2019t join she decides to kill them all bar actor TVA guy, coincidentally using the shrinking box thing Loki used in episode two but this time she turns around ten people into sludge but it doesn\u2019t matter because in the end nothing they did made any difference and now enchanted TVA guy sends her back to the end of time void place with the glow stick - so she\u2019s back where she was at the beginning of the ep only she\u2019s not in the house that isn\u2019t guarded by Eliath anymore presumably because Sophie enchanted it in season one and then the Loom explodes killing everyone but we know it totally hasn\u2019t and wow I really don\u2019t care about this season at all!<\n\nIn short I am kind of bored and checked out of Loki season two. Lots seems to be happening, but also absolutely nothing is actually happening. Marvel are on a terrible streak hey.

I *love* the scifi concept too  a 'la Dark, so was intrigued.\n\nIt has such a great premise but I just couldn't fully enjoy it :( Some of the dialogue was fucking atrociously bad and ruined a few characters (the 2023 cop was just shit imho - no fault of the actor).\n\nThe future cop and the love affair pair in the 1890's both seem GREAT characters though. Really enjoyed that part so far...but the weakness elsewhere is a barrier.\n\nDid anybody else feel the same at first but kept going? Does it improve / is it worth it?",

I would argue that you could just start with Season 3 as it's largely been a new storyline but if you didn't like the first two seasons know that there is continuity in the underlying nature of the show.

The first episode didn't really grab me, I actually could barely remember it when I watched the second episode the next day, but the rest of the show made an impact. Actually, all of Mike Flanagan's works that I've seen have stuck with me.\n\nI must say though, I was skeptical after The (Unscary, Love-Focused) Haunting of Bly Manor. I was disappointed with the tone he chose for that one, and that he felt the need to explain the motivations of every ghost. I think movies like Paranormal Activity and The Exorcist creep people out so much because of the unknown. What is it? What does it want? What can it do? It's like when you were a kid and you were afraid that something was going to \"get\" you. Does that mean kill you, eat you, skin you, gouge your eyes out, condemn your soul??? Not knowing what it's going to do with you when it *gets* you is the scariest part, so I think it's best to leave enough mystery surrounding it. And I think there was little to no mystery left by the end. Like the ghosts weren't even supposed to be villains but instead they were characters you sympathized with. And that's not scary.",

This season had a lot of slow episodic progression as they take the longest way around to get to their destination, but the different encounters and adventures that delay their journey were still fun to watch.  Then, in the last few episodes, they realize they must end the season soon, so it kicks into crazy high gear with a climactic fight that does feel like a proper finale.  It just rushed out of little build up. So, I guess the pacing was off and they just wanted many different filler episodes in between but it was not nearly as annoying as in other series.
