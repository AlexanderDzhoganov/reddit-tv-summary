The first half of the season played out like classic H&CF, but was somehow lackluster and lacked the sauce that made the previous two seasons memorable. I enjoyed the last 5 episodes more, with the unexpected turns that completely changes the future of the characters and storyline for the final season. IMO, the creative choices made in the last 3 episodes were rushed and felt very much unlike H&CF, but i am willing to accept it for the sake of the fourth and final season, and for my love of seasons 1 & 2.\n\nOnto S4!!",

            "body": "**Under the Bridge:** is it bad that this episode with zero Cam and/or Rebecca has been my favorite of the show so far? Because I thought this week\u2019s episode was beautifully done. Maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for a well-done flashback episode. Going back and forth between the beginning of Manjit and Suman\u2019s relationship to the dinner with the Seven Oaks girls made the episode\u2019s end scene that much more of a gut punch. I wasn\u2019t sure about this show in the first couple episodes, but I\u2019m officially hooked and watching to the end. \n\n**Hacks:** this week I rewatched all season 2 in the lead-up to the magnificent season 3 opener we got and it was a great decision. Jean Smart is just the best. I love her and I love the episodes we\u2019ve gotten so far.\n- This show in general does an amazing job taking me from laughing to crying in short succession, but episode 2 made me pause the show for a second because of tears. The call-out to >!Deirdre Hall, queen of Days of Our Lives, being Jimmy\u2019s mother!< extra special to me. My mom, who passed away in October, loved >!DOOL and she frequently used Deirdre Hall as inspiration for her hairstylists.!< She and I watched the first season together and at that moment, it felt like she was watching season 3 with me too. :)\n\n**Superstore:** second time watching all the way through for me - showing it to my SO for the first time. We are in early season 3 and we just met Kelly and watched a couple of my favorite episodes of the show (Workplace Bullying and Sal\u2019s Dead). I feel like season 3 is probably my favorite season of the show and excited to get through more of it!\n\n**Mare of Easttown:** again, a second time watch for me while I show it to my SO for his first time. It was a lot of fun to hear his theories as we went along and to share some of the absolutely bonkers theories that popped up on Reddit with him when the show was first airing. He loved it and I enjoyed the ending much more than I did the first time around (probably because I got way too into theory-crafting on Reddit with this show while it was airing). I truly hope this is left as a stand-alone miniseries and they don\u2019t try to bog it down with a second season. Kate Winslet is incredible but Mare\u2019s story ended exactly where it needed to.\n\nI generally watch **Abbott Elementary** week-to-week but haven\u2019t gotten to the newest episode yet (because we got to a point finally where SO wanted to finish Mare last night because he couldn\u2019t go to sleep without knowing how it ended). Hoping it is back to business as usual now that >!Janine is officially back at Abbott.!<\n\nNext up: Shogun; Fallout\n\n**UPDATE:** We started **Fallout** and I am IN. Yes, I WILL watch just about anything with Walton Goggins, but I\u2019m impressed with the pilot episode even aside from him. Ella Purnell is great (love you Jackie, >!nice to see you with both ears!<), the three threads we\u2019re following are all mostly interesting and I like the callout to game mechanics, which adds a bit of fun. Didn\u2019t realize this was Jonathan Nolan until the credits, but I definitely was already feeling Westworld vibes. Excited to watch some more of this throughout the week!",

It's a terrific show.\n\nWhile the complaints about pacing are somewhat valid, it's worth pointing out the show tends to be two episodes of buildup, then an action-heavy episode, then another two episodes of buildup, and then another actioner.

            "body": "Fallout - 9 out of 10. Just like so many people have said before. It is a fantastic combination of sci-fi elements, comedic absurdity, what-the-fuckery and just fun.\u00a0\u00a0It does encapsulate the randomness of the encounters in the best open-world games, where you don\u2019t know what demented characters, lore or creatures you will encounter the next area you\u2019ll explore, but you can\u2019t wait for it. A lot of people highlight Walton Goggins job as despicable Ghoul, but the main actress, Ella Purnell , deserves equal praise for making her naive character vey likable and engaging when generally this type of character gets annoying really quick. A truly enjoyable series for gamers and nongamers alike, and another great shattering of the video game adaptation curse.\n\nShogun - 7.5 out of 10.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like this story had a bigger impact on me when I read it way back when than watching it now. It\u2019s a bit sad because it is one of my favorite books, though maybe it would lose its luster on a current reread.\u00a0\u00a0I like that this series was done with a lot of care, with the creators truly doing their best in transporting the audience into feudal Japan and immersing them deep into the Japanese culture of the time.\u00a0\u00a0However, there were some elements of it that prevented me from enjoying it as much as most people seemed to have around here. I never really cared about or connected with the main character for example.\u00a0\u00a0He definitely comes across as awkward in most of the scenes he is in, in body posture, gestures and line delivery. I get that he is a stranger in a strange land, but something about his performance came across as an alien learning to maneuver a human body. Plot wise , he spends so much time as a pawn without agency that he often just amounts to be a distraction at best.\u00a0\u00a0You could remove him from the story and most of the stuff can still happen with a similar outcome.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, his knowledge of European cannon tactics is put to use in real history, by the figure he\u2019s based on, but goes nowhere in the show\u2019s story. Lady Mariko and Lord Yabushige were the highlights for me, with a lot of their personality coming through even in moments without dialogue. Regarding Toranaga, though, it felt like the character was made more mysterious and clever by the writers than allowed to demonstrate through his actions.\u00a0\u00a0He is supposed to be a master schemer, always having plans within plans, but like he said later \u201che just reads the wind\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0He goes along with whatever happens, with his plans never wowing and relying more on luck or on things working out because they just will. In the final episode he has a quote regarding the Anjin that was completely disconnected from the rest of the script, something akin to keeping him around because he made him laugh, which doesn\u2019t feel true or earned.\u00a0\u00a0They worked really hard in giving him an aura of inscrutability to the point of providing a character that you don\u2019t really know who he is or why should we care about him and his actions, just someone who we should just assume is a masterful tactician because they say so.\u00a0\u00a0I also expected more multi-faction strife involving the Portuguese, but they only really matter at the beginning and then are just delegated somewhere to the background with only the one priest doing anything meaningful in the final scenes.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, it is a good show, and very different than the usual fare, but I would have never expected to be more amazed and engrossed by Fallout than Shogun.",

Its a solid sci-fi show that focuses more on the drama going on.  Loved all the actors and the dialogue and plot moved at a decent pace.  \n\nI also watched The **Night** **Sky** at the same time and really wish that got a 2nd season.   It wasn\u2019t as good as Outer Range, IMO, but was a pretty solid show that towards the end started to fall apart for me. \n\nOther than that binged the following shows in order of favorite to least \n\n1.) Fallout - Amazon Prime- just can\u2019t give this show enough praise, phenomenal and loved it all the way through.   Watched it 2x already and feel this will be another regular repeat show for me. \n\n2.) Baby Reindeer - Netflix - didn\u2019t know what to expect when it first popped up on Netflix but wow what a great show. I was surprised to learn the main actor is the one who this all happened to and this was his debut - he did such a fantastic job overall.   This show is getting a lot of hype, as it deserves, so most by now probably know it centers around a serious stalker. \n\n3.) Dead Boy Detectives club (Netflix) - initially had a hard time getting into it for some reason but once it got going I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Reminds me of a mix of The Magicians and Being Human. \n\n4.) Them Season 2- Prime - it was good but that\u2019s about it.  Had some really good scary moments in it so that\u2019s a plus.  Overall I preferred season 1 and with this season had a hard time getting to the end. \n\n5.) Three Body Problem (Netflix) - I think it\u2019s so low on the list as I had much higher expectations.  For me it felt like there was something very off with the pacing & flow of the dialogue, at times it felt like I was watching a D list movie.  Not sure if that was just me or if anyone else got that vibe.",

I had to replay the bank scene for them all later and reassure them even in context it's every bit as WTF.  I've been really excited to watch Three Body Problem and Fallout, my expectations for the former are pretty low though so maybe I will feel less disappointed with, conversely, I'm worried now hearing how good Fallout is that I will end up disappointed with that one.",

I think both fit in the fantastical/quirky aspect perfectly, are mostly feel good, and very enjoyable. Those two are solid for adults too. I'd also add Hilda, though it's definitely a bit \"kiddier\" but god is it a warm hug of a fantasy show.\n\nA bit dark maybe for what you're looking for, but I think still work: Wednesday and A Series of Unfortunate Events. Both are kinda dark and feel good isn't necessarily an accurate descriptor, but I don't think they're like overly depressing and they definitely fit fantastical and quirky.\n\nFinally, the one that fits the best I think is Lodge 49. It's about a guy who joins an Elks/Masons type organization but it gets so weird and engaging and fun.\n\nOH, Detectorists might fit? It's not fantastical and it's only a little quirky, but it IS very feel good.\n\nQuirky and fantastical is ALWAYS something I'm looking for more of. Maybe my favorite kind of show.",

All answers are very subjective, obviously. \nI would try to think about what mood you want to be in.\n\nSopranos is always #1 pick for me.  It changed television forever. It manages to tackle deep and relatable themes, while also being the funniest show ever.  I quote it daily.  \n\nMy second pick is Mad Men.  Creator of Mad Men was a head writer on Sopranos.  You can see similar themes.  It\u2019s very witty, dry humor mostly.  totally captivating.  Amazing characters and character development. \nTalk about a mood- you are jumping into the 1960\u2019s in a very realistic way.  Set designs and brilliant costume designer Janie Bryant set mad men on a different level.  \n\nThe wire 3rd.  It could be 2nd but I prefer mood of Mad Men over Wire.  This is your first time watching any of these.- the wire is pretty incredible.  Groundbreaking in many ways. It\u2019s a must watch.  \n\nUnpopular opinion- not a huge Breaking Bad fan.  I\u2019ll get downvoted for this bc this sub has some serious BB fanatics.  I loved it first watch.  But second time I just was not invested.  As far as mood goes it\u2019s high-speed and intense.  Sometimes I can\u2019t handle too much of that energy. Idk that\u2019s just me. \n\nGOT is just fun! First 4 seasons are fantastic.  Weird to say this is the lightest themed show of them all but it\u2019s true in some ways.  \n\nI am jealous of you getting to watch these all for the first time!! You better get started!",
