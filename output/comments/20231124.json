I almost gave up on the series after the disappointing fourth season, but I was glad I had persevered through and decided to give the new season a watch. It was worth it, at least to me. The casting, quirkiness, and awkward slapstick comedy native to the Fargo series are back in business.",

            "body": "I had 2 6 hour train rides this week so I had TONS of tv to watch! \n\n**Halt and Catch Fire** on AMC+ through Prime seasons 2, 3 and 4. It's a blast watching these folks come up with every single computer innovation in the last 30 years, heh, but seriously, it's sheer delight watching people work and find so much joy and purpose. I have a few small quibbles--for openers I couldn't care less about Joanie and I personally don't find Donna the villain. I wanted to reach through the screen and strangle the bro-y partner dude in Season 4 on her behalf. As a woman who has watched hundreds of average, not talented, beer-brained assholes get ahead in the Old Boys' Club, I 100% feel her anger and frustration. \n\n**A Murder at the End of the World** on Hulu (FX). It's satisfying, if a bit by the numbers (a phone call from a person of interest \"I want to tell you...[cut off]\" and then POI dies) I'll keep watching! \n\n**Rap Shit** on HBOMax. Consistently solid. Watching Mia and Shawna fumble their way through their 20s and the music scene and hearing amazing music never gets old. NEED MORE LIKE THIS if the general r/televsion crowd has any (that's not Atlanta, I've already seen that)\n\n**The Crown Final Season** on Netflix. The angst and pain of watching Diana's final weeks, days, and hours knowing what's coming--augh. Wanting to reach through the screen STAY AT THE RITZ! I also felt Dodi and Diana could uniquely understand each other and that's shown well here--the level of fame, pressure, celebrity, and their shy, complicated personalities made them at the very least friends, if not perfect lovers. I am VERY iffy on Ghost Diana. I FF through her scenes but weirdly I liked Ghost Dodi! I cried when MouMou cried for Dodi not to leave him. I find that depiction of talking to your recently lost loved ones very, very realistic. \n\n**Taking Care of Maya** on Netflix. This is a rare case where Netflix could have made a much longer series! So many questions! I cried more than once on this one. I was enraged. But...I admit, it seems like Beata had an underlying personality disorder that people are dancing around out of respect to her memory here. 90 days, while agonizing, doesn't feel like too long and certainly not long enough to **end your life** over. However, I've never been in that unique hell and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, so I can't really judge. \n\n**Escaping the Twin Flames Universe** on HBO Max Jesus Christ do I hate Jeff. What an abusive, egomaniacal asshole. Watching him berate his \"Twin Flame\", imitate her **objection to his sexual assault** because that's 100% what it was, btw, in a voice dripping with contempt, chew out his followers--I DETEST this person. I hope he gets jail time. For people who listened to the podcast, there's not much new in the doc, FYI. It's nice and interesting to put faces to names but it feels a bit thin and insubstantial in places, compared to the podcast. \n\nMovie: High Life with Robert Pattison. O...kay. Where to start. I didn't finish this--bailed with about 30 minutes to go. I really wanted to like it, I love pretentious, portentous sci fi art house flicks. And Juliet Binoche does not pick dogs. But I dunno. So much body fluid. So many inexplicable and unrealistic actions. I really recoiled at the choice to show an AFAB infant's private area clearly. I'm not sure an infant can consent and it feels exploitive. The plot really hinges on feeling sorry for or at the very least understanding the main character, Monte, and I...didn't. I have ZERO space in my heart for male psycho killers with a heart of gold characters. ZERO. However, some stunning visuals and a real kernel of something there. I loved the 70s soviet feeling of the sets and costumes and vibe. Robert does a good job with what he has and Juliet kills it--I loved her character. Mia Goth elevates her material very consistently. But ultimately it just didn't gel for me.",

Those who never considered watching, it's a japanese show about a teenager who finds a note in the street which can kill anyone whose name is written inside. The teenager starts using the note and an investigation starts as a result. I highly recommend it for both who like or don't like animated shows, it has great characters, writing and all episodes that I've seen so far, contain developments that keep getting more and more interesting, not necessarily to an anime fan but from a storytelling perspective.",

So I need to get through all 50 episodes before then, having never seen it in full prior. Enjoying it greatly so far, and Syd Mead's mechanical designs provide a great contrast to the Gundam series that came before it.\n\n**The Afterparty** was a pleasant surprise. Season 1 is a nice compact mystery, though the premise of \"each episode reflects events in the lens of a different person and genre\" isn't always a winner. The first episode of Season 2 is probably one of the funniest straight-forward episodes of TV I've seen in recent memory. Shame it got canned after season 2, but definitely worth a watch.",

I love the show's creativity in how it told the story and loved the meta-aspects, like the cooking demonstration with actors Brie Larson and Lewis Pullman, and Apple TV actually running a real cooking contest on the Lessons in Chemistry website, which ties into the cooking contest mentioned in the show itself.   I'm not reading the Lessons in Chemistry book and really enjoying it as well.\n\n**Monarch S1 Ep3 (Apple TV)** \\-- We get to see more Kurt Russell and more giant monsters. It may not be serious drama but I'm loving this action-based monster show. It's much better than expected.\n\n**The Bear S2 Ep8 to Ep10  (Hulu / FX)** \\--- Finished the second season of The Bear. I had doubts it would be as good as season one, so this was a pleasant surprise. I'm glad the show took some risks with its formula. Maybe the first season is a bit tighter, but I think some of my favorite episodes came from this season two, and I loved the guest appearances by some big name stars. Cameos often fail but it worked here.\n\n**Will Trent S1 Ep1 (Hulu)** \\-- I had heard good things about this show, and while it didn't \"wow\" me, and found the show comforting. It reminded me of Monk, the Mentalist, Psych and other cop shows that features a detective sleuth with some kind of unusual quirk. I'll check out the next few episode and see if I like it.",

It can swing between laugh-oud comedy to disturbing violience. Both are excellent shows.  \n\n**Twin Peaks** \\-- also a weird mix of crime and humor, but with a little horror too. It can get surreal, like BB or BCS but even more so since this is David Lynch, who is known for his surrealist films.  If you get to season three, after watching S1 + S2 + the Firewalk With Me movie, you'll see some of the best TV you'll ever see. Super funny, super creepy, super weird -- very weird. It even adds a touch of sci-fi too. \n\nYou might want to also try **The X-files**. \n\nVince Gillian, the creator of BB and BCS, first became known for his work on The X-Files. Gillian wrote some of the most famous epiisodes of that show.  It's an old-school TV show with a mystery (sometimes monster) of the week format but there's an over-arching narrative. It can get quite funny as the seasons progress but at its core its a sci-fi mystery show. \n\nSome really epic TV shows that are complete with great characters\n\n**Dark** (great time travel show with an intricate and super crazy plot)\n\n**Last Kingdom** (a lighter version of Game of Thrones with great characters and tons of action)",

I am ticked off that Disney+ hasn't seen fit to also include [the commentary track](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-whoniverse-commentary-newsupdate/) or the [*Doctor Who Unleashed*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEq6KPQsjJE) episode, though, so I mashed [their \"Submit Feedback\" button](https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-content-suggestion). :D\n\nI love that this episode is based on an '80s comics story by Pat Mills and Dave Gibbons. I love that we're basically in a throwback to  Season 4. I love the new TARDIS set incorporating so much classic-Who feel and yet being utterly of the new series. I'm loving RTD being back at the helm and flexing his queer-represent superpowers (I was worried he was going to have to rein that in, given how insanely good he's been at it with everything he's written since *Doctor Who: Banana/Cucumber, A Very English Scandal, Years and Years,* and *It's a Sin*). But nope, not at all. \n\nI also hadn't really realized how long it's been and how far we'd drifted from the RTD seasons until we came back. Can't wait for the rest of the specials and the new season. And to see Neil Patrick Harris working with RTD again. \n\nsidenote: In the wake of reading about [the BBC First Folio mini-season](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2023/shakespeare-first-folio-400-anniversary-pan-bbc-season), I found the RTD *Midsummer Night's Dream* is up [on Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Midsummer-Nights-Dream-John-Hannah/dp/B0CG75W1M8) in the US. And it's very RTD-*Doctor Who-*ish in presentation. But I likes me some iambic pentameter and British actors. YMMV. \n\n***Faraway Downs*** (Hulu). I went there so you don't have to! Srsly, the longer cut doesn't make it something completely different, but it feels a bit more watchable extended like this with episodic rhythms and breaks rather than trying to be sustained as a single nearly three-hour (2:45) non-stop narrative. The new title sequences/music help give you little resets between episodes. \n\nThe majority of the six episodes clock in around the 30-to-40 minute mark, so in total it's roughly a 3 hour and 30 min. cut of *Australia,* so really only extending the runtime over the theatrical version by less than an hour. Oh, and the ending changed :). I enjoyed it, but it's been ages since I first saw the movie and I was largely indifferent to it then, and I'd recently been watching [*Muster Dogs*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBe4n-Dgvw4) on Netflix, so driving the cattle mob was more fun this time around. :D  I'm also a comparative viewing fool (I keep meaning to find [the Singapore/Malaysia version of *Bron|Broen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGESoQN7q74)*.*..) It's an interesting experiment, but I don't think most people (or films) need to go there.",

They're definitely leaning into reproductive rights and making full use of the '60s setting as well as continuing their love letter to \\[W\\]GBH and Public Television, publishing, and, of course Julia Child and food. They just keep blowing me away every week. And Rachel Bloom is kinda killing it as the latest addition to the cast. This show, despite not being the same in tone or machine-gun dialogue, is definitely filling the hole that *Marvelous Mrs. Maisel* left behind for me.\n\n***Planet Earth III*** (BBC America / AMC+). Oh. Look. Something *actually* British on BBC America \\[eyeroll\\]. But as per usual, the Planet Earth team are killing it. **Much** better watch than PBS doing *Spy in the Ocean* (cameras in robots disguised as animals) where for whatever reason they choices to replace the David Tennant voiceover.\n\n***Found*** (NBC/Peacock) continues to be my network crime procedural fix of the week, since *The Irrational*'s on hiatus (they ran out of finished episodes) and won't be back (along with the other network dramas) until Feb/March. Stronger than I thought it would be, but my expectations were pretty low. :D  Not for you unless you like network broadcast crime procedurals.\n\n***The Gilded Age S2*** (HBO/Max). Continues to amuse me, but again, if you're not period-costume-drama/Julian Fellowes inclined, may not be for you. I'm loving it and how Fellowes as a Brit is having fun playing with how this being an American show lets him ring some changes he couldn't do with Downton: such as characters who rise/fall between the classes, and putting in American reactions to a Duke as well as having Peggy meeting Booker T. Washington.  Also, Carrie Coon is *really* killing it as Bertha ruthlessly works towards her social goals. With the advent of the Duke, I'm guessing Fellowes wants to put Gladys into a  [Consuelo Vanderbilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consuelo_Vanderbilt)/Dollar Princess/Buccaneers/Cora Crawley storyline. :D\n\n***Santa Clauses S2*** (Disney+). I'm not proud. And the holidays tend to exhaust me emotionally to the point of needing a something silly. :D This fills the bill admirably, and hearing Laura San Giacomo proclaim \"I'm-a Italian!\" as La Belfana was just >chef kiss<.\n\n***Bodies*** (Netflix). You'd think a time travel crime thriller would be able to hold interest better. It wasn't terrible as I finished it, but I kept zoning in and out. Not much interest in the Victorian or WWII action, more interested in the 2053 and modern day. And the story logic just...wasn't. Someone on *Pop-Culture Happy Hour* likened it to *The Class of '09* with the time-hopping and that's very true tonally. But *Class of '09* was also critically exploring social issues of policing \\[not always successfully, but an A for effort and Tom Rob Smith still has credit with me for *ACS: The Assassination of Gianni Versace,* *London Spy* and *MotherFatherSon*\\], not just adapting a comic book. :)\n\n***Spy x Family*** (Hulu).  The cruise ship storyline is making me happy. I just miss Bond.\n\n***Fargo*** ***S5*** \\[Hulu\\] is next in the queue.\n\nComing up for me:\n\n* ~~- 11/29.~~ *Marvel Studios Assembled: The Making of Loki S2*.

The caveat is that I had been looking for a good sci-fi show to fill the *The Expanse*-sized hole in my heart so I was almost always going to enjoy this one.\n\nI really thought it was going to be more hard sci-fi leaning, but I would say it's almost as much fantasy as it is sci-fi. In some cases they explain fantastical elements of the show as a result of complicated science and in other cases they use advanced technology for the explanation of things that are effectively just magic. It's not a criticism, just an observation.\n\nTo me, season one and two almost feel like two completely different shows to the point where I would believe they changed showrunners in the middle of it. I can't even accurately describe why I feel this way, they just feel stylistically very different. The first season felt a little tighter and more purposeful to me because all of the stories were mostly self-contained but there weren't many big spectacles and nothing really stood out to me. Then in season two all of the storylines start to collide and there is so much crazy shit happening all over the place and it feels like everything is just going off the rails but it manages to stay on track and come together in the end.\n\nWhat I love the most about this show is all of the really interesting sci-fi and fantasy ideas they use. I had to look up how much of it was from Asimov and expectedly I found out this show is not even an adaptation really, but more takes some very light inspiration from the source material and is very much its own thing. All of the empire stuff is amazing and creates such an interesting dynamic. Along the lines of creating a lasting legacy, I also like the show's three unique takes on >!immortality!< and the impact it has on a story that takes place over many centuries. The political intrigue really ramps up in season two and there are quite a few twists and turns. The universe also starts to feel appropriately large with the stakes constantly increasing.\n\nI do have some minor criticisms but there is so much good content in this show that they are easy for me to overlook. Objectively I think this show is a solid 8/10 if you like the genre, but for me it's an easy 9/10 in terms of enjoyment.",

They find a bag with an enormous amount of money in it and have to decide what to do with it. It\u2019s co-created by Stephen Merchant, who also costars.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly a breezy comedy but has these moments of drama surprisingly hard. \n\nThere are moments that stretch believability but doesn\u2019t matter because the cast is so strong and likable. The  aforementioned Merchant along with the always reliable Christopher Walken are joined by a lot of actors who are unknown to me but are all excellent like Eleanor Tomlinson, Gamba Cole, and Charles Babalola. At the heart of the show is Rani, played by the magnetic Rhianne Barreto, a young girl caught between who she thinks she\u2019s supposed to be and who she really is. \n\nI really love this show. There are two seasons and the end of the second could reasonably be the end of the show, and it doesn\u2019t end  how you think it would, but I\u2019ve since learned that there\u2019s a third season coming which I\u2019m excited for. \n\n\nIt\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got a bit of action in it and it\u2019s got a ton of heart. \nStrongly recommended.",

Each season has a different narrative focus which might take some getting used to, I personally really like seeing the different perspectives of Baltimore, helps keep it fresh. For a grounded and realistic approach to the subject matter, nothing comes close. It can be a double-edged sword as you watch people OD, children get killed in crossfire, rampant corruption go undeterred, and brutal violence normalized. \n\nDespite being a fictional story, the core of it is based on real stories and a dedication to crafting a realistic narrative that can really be applicable to any big city with a crime problem. It fully immerses you in a fictionalized world that's grounded in reality and makes you question so much about life. I would recommend this to everyone, but you should be prepared for something complex and depressing **10/10 the best show ever made.** \n\n**Superstore** *Complete series rewatch* - One of the most consistent sitcoms ever made, every season is between a 7.5-8.5. It might not have the highs of peak Office/Parks & Rec/Community/It's Always Sunny, but none of Superstore's seasons are as bad as the previously mentioned lows. It takes time to develop the secondary characters to incorporate them more without flanderizing them. Guaranteed to get at least a couple of strong laughs every episode. **8/10**",

            "body": "**Superman The Animated Series season 3**\n\nAnother overall strong season, to wrap things up on.  My favorite episodes were the two Batman crossovers (\"Knight Time,\" and \"The Demon Reborn\"), and the 2-part finale.  I also liked the team-ups with Green Lantern and Aquaman.  And I enjoyed many of the stand-alone episodes, but the 2 that stand out the most in my mind are \"Absolute Power,\" and \"Unity.\"\n\nFor the finale in particular, I thought it left things on a somewhat interesting note.  I do feel like they were setting things up for a potential season 4 (and maybe they'll carry things over into Justice League/Justice League Unlimited?), but as a finale itself...  It's bittersweet enough that I can see some people not caring for it, but I kind of liked it in an odd way.\n\n**Static Shock season 1**\n\nStarting my 3rd of the DC Animated Universe shows, now that I'm done with Superman TAS, and nearing the end of Batman TAS.  Going into this, I wasn't really familiar with Static's character unlike I was with Batman and Superman.  However, I'd say they did a good job of establishing the characters and getting me invested.  I will say it's a bit more rough around the edges than the other shows.  I'm a bit more mixed on the art style, although I did get used to it after a while (and I do see they change things up after this season).  And the villains can be a bit of a mixed bag, with some feeling a bit shallow, but others can be good, with some fun ideas thrown into the mix (like Rubberband Man).  I do like how it tries to portray certain issues that regular people may have to deal with.  For example, one fan favorite episode deals with racism.  And an aspect I really liked was Virgil's home life, as a single-parent family after his mother died before the start of the series.  I thought the finale episode in particular did a good job dealing with that.\n\n**Castlevania Nocturn**\n\nHonestly, I appreciate the different approach to the story compared to the original series.  A slower, more character-focused show, where we get to know a larger group of characters, see what the vampire hunting means to them, and how they work together as a group.  I can see how some fans of the original may not care for this take as much, and honestly I wouldn't say it's quite matched that series for me yet, but I'd still say it's a good follow-up in its own way, and I like how they're building up the bigger story arc so far, and it did set things up for a potentially much more exciting season 2.\n\n**Attack on Titan season 2**\n\nA great follow-up to the first season.  I like how it develops several of the side-characters beyond the main trio of the first season, so it's starting to feel like a better ensemble.  The main mysteries were well done, as it builds up to some bigger conflicts towards the end of the season.  And as with the first season, the action sequences are especially exciting and well animated, probably even outdoing the first season in some ways.\n\n**My Dress-Up Darling**\n\nAs a fan of Cloverworks' Bocchi the Rock and Spy X Family, I was curious to see what other big hits they might have, and came across this anime.  TBH, I was a bit less sure about the cosplay aspect of this than the music and spy themes of those other shows, but was still interested in watching it.  And I thought it was enjoyable.  Maybe a bit more fanservice-y than I care for (but I guess that comes more \"naturally\" with cosplay), but I thought the main characters were fun.  And the actual cosplay aspect was handled pretty well IMO.  It's still my least favorite of the Cloverworks anime shows I've seen, but has the high quality and fun of the other works.\n\n**Chainsaw Man**\n\nI'd heard a lot of praise for this one, and ended up really liking it especially once the story really gets going.  I admittedly didn't expect the main character to be so over-the-top eccentric, and it took me a bit to get used to him.  What helps is once the bigger group starts to come together, so we get to see his interactions with them all.  For example, I liked his dynamic with Power, a devil whose personality isn't that much different than Denji's.  Conversely, there's the much more professional Aki, who doesn't have much patience with Denji's unique personality.  And there are a few other characters who have interesting dynamics with him.\n\nFor the main plot, I thought it was pretty enjoyable early on, with some really good action sequences.  But it was 6 episodes in where it really started to pick up a lot.  I really liked that episode's growing tension and sci-fi/fantasy concepts, and that's the arc which really solidified this group.  And it really maintained the momentum from there IMO.\n\n**Riverdale**\n\nI've been watching this on Netflix for a while, and just finished the final season.  A lot has been said about this show's off-the-rails stories.  I can see this leading to a love-it-or-hate-it reaction by viewers, depending on how much you can embrace that craziness.  Personally, I thought it was fun in its own way, even if I didn't love some of the choices they made.  For example, I wasn't a fan of the musical episodes they had every year (I don't inherently hate musical episodes, but outside of comedies and animation I can be pretty mixed on the idea).",

I agree with the general sentiment that the mere existence of this show kind of betrays the main point of the actual show, but as a Squid Game-themed reality/game show it's enjoyable enough. They craft some interesting situations that put the players in challenging positions, which I liked... But the rules for some of the games/challenges are pretty bad and holy shit these players are soooo bad at strategizing. As a fan of old-school Survivor is baffling to me how bad these people are.\n\n---\n\nI'm still enjoying **Invincible** but man is it frustrating waiting 2.5 years for the second season, only for it to be further delayed by a mid-season break. Like yeah I get these things can take time but it's pretty disappointing. There is so much potential still left in this show and I'm still going to rabidly consume it as it comes out, but I can't help but feel like no matter how good it is, it's not going to be worth the soon-to-be three year wait.\n\n---\n\nI feel a bit guilty for not liking **The Fall of the House of Usher** more. It's a great show. It's well-made. The acting is amazing. I had to look up all of the references to Edgar Allen Poe's works to fully appreciate all of the love and appreciation that went into it and I think they did a commendable job. I really enjoyed what were effectively the short stories being told in episodes 2-7 but for a majority of the series I could not figure out what they were trying to do with the overarching storyline. I guess that's really my biggest gripe.\n\nI would frame it more as a show that is largely told like an anthology series where each story is one slice of a much larger story, and where events that happen are driven more by karma and poetic justice than something actually tangible within the show's world. I simply don't understand why they weren't more forthcoming about the information revealed in the last episode. I know they set the expectation in the very first episode that not everything is as it seems and/or there is an unreliable narrator, but it just seems so unnecessary to hide that information from the viewer. For me, I think if I had known some or all of the information from the last episode by the end of the first episode instead that I would have enjoyed the series as a whole a lot more.\n\nI don't want to just sound like a downer though. I did ultimately enjoy it. There was a lot about it that I liked and I think if I come back to this show in a few years for a rewatch that I will enjoy and appreciate it a lot more. The ambience of the show is appropriately macabre and is great at capturing a creepy and unsettling sort of vibe. I just think if they kept all of the same pieces of the show and rearranged them slightly then it would have been a lot better for me personally. It's a good show but you have to go into it with the right mindset, or at least not the wrong mindset.",

The 8-episode series finds Raylan still a marshal in Florida, with his daughter (played by Olyphant's actual daughter) for the weekend. A couple of criminals attempt car-jack them, but Raylan is having none of that, and the fugitives are soon in custody, and on their way to Detroit. In short order Raylan is caught up with a crooked judge (who has a little Black Book), a police partner, and Clement Mansell, a wily Oklahoma killer and thief (Boyd Holbrook), who has a lady lawyer, a girlfriend working a con on an Albanian (who is related to the mob), and a reluctant accomplice who owns a bar.\n\nThe series is tightly plotted, often very well-written, and after numerous twists and unexpected events, resolves itself quite satisfactorily.

Just started ep3 but jury still out on whether it's gonna be a keeper. I did see I finished Dark S1 so I may see if I can pick up on S2 without rewatching S1. Otherwise am gonna need to find a new hobby at this rate... which I don't wanna.",

They didn't get A.C. Bradley, because she's head writer on *What If...?* at the moment. :D\n\n*Trollhunters* is a Dreamworks animated series on Netflix that was created by Guillermo del Toro and showrun by Marc Guggenheim. It was so successful it went on to spawn another series ([*3 Below*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVmNGUA-eo)), miniseries ([*Wizards*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6adVDTR79n4)) and movie ([*Rise of the Titans*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H4Y21Hg2L8)) in the \"Tales of Arcadia\" franchise. The animation/design aesthetic, to me at least, is similar to *Prodigy.*\n\nWith *GL:TAS* (which I've been recommending ever since I watched it on broadcast as \"everything we wanted from a Green Lantern movie and never got\" :-)*,* the showrunners were [Giancarlo Volpe](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2083477) and Jim Krieg.\n\nVolpe was one of the directors on *AtLA* and *Clone Wars* \\[think: Dave Filoni\\]*,* and one of the three co-creators on Netflix's [*The Dragon Prince*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-djK0YhLmg)*.* He's joked on Twitter that Razer is just another version of Zuko. :D  [Jim Krieg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0471172) is one of those wandering-ronin-writers for hire who's worked all over animation. But he holds a special place in my heart for having been one of the two guys who wrote [the \"Scoobynatural\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDF0nqU7OLM) (s13e16) script of *Supernatural,* as well as writing a couple episodes for WETA's [*Thunderbirds Are Go*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQwgIZ__WrY) series, which is insanely faithful in spirit to [the OG '60s \"marionation\" show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HWhEikJmIM), down to [the intricate miniatures work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTEB1oP3FQE).\n\nLast note: I'm assuming you're not in the US.  Here, Paramount+ has, of course, dropped/cancelled *Prodigy,* even off of Nickelodeon, where it was airing on linear cable, but **Netflix** is picking it up (as well as the already-completed [Season 2](https://www.startrek.com/videos/star-trek-prodigy-season-2-first-look)),  So... this one is actually going to be yet another animated series on Netflix. :D  S1 will be dropping on Netflix Dec. 25.

It looks great and the cast is very solid, but the plotting just felt very messy and, at times, a bit lazy. Specifically, it's never really made clear to the audience what the \"rules\" of the universe are, and since we don't really know the boundaries of what is possible, a lot of plot moments just feel like unexplained space magic operating as deus ex machina. I was sort of surprised to see so much praise for the new season on reddit, but i guess it's good that other people liked it.",

Lee Pace is fantastic, as is Laura Birn as Demerzel. There is some momentum now with The Mule on the foundation side, so that's something at least. >!And Salvor's acting/character has been so wooden and uninspired for two full seasons that I feel moving past her is also a big positive for the show going forward.!<",

                    "body": "[*Twilight Zone* (1985)](https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Zone-Complete-80s/dp/B08GRH4QGT).  Often overlooked in all the other TZs :). But take a look at [the writing and acting credits over on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Twilight_Zone_(1985_TV_series)_episodes). And also, on the DVD set?  A lot of the episodes have commentary tracks. Harlan Ellison did the one for \"Paladin of the Lost Hour\" (which starred Danny Kaye).  I think he also did one for \"Gramma\" where he was adapted the Stephen King short story.\n\nThey never roped GRRM in to do his episodes (he adapted Roger Zelazny's \"Last Defender of Camelot\" among his episodes), but Alan Brennert did a fair few, and his commentary with Phil Deguere (showrunner) and Wes Craven (director) on \"Her Pilgrim Soul\" is nearly as good as the episode.  I will also note that \"Shatterday\" starred a pre-*Moonlighting* Bruce Willis, and the gender-swapped remake of \"Dead Man's Shoes\" from the OG series, \"Dead Woman's Shoes\" starred Helen Mirren.\n\nOther writers include *Farscape's* showrunner, Rockne S. O'Bannon, and J. Michael Straczynski and B:TAS's Michael Reaves.\n\nAnother DVD set with some outstanding commentary would be  *Leverage*. John Rogers is basically holding a showrunning master class on those commentaries. I forget which episode it is that he begins to wax rhapsodic about all the advantages of switching to RED digital cameras midway through the run. :D\n\nI think the DVD set of *Jekyll* is probably out of print, but if you can find it, it is, in some ways, a predecessor to *Sherlock.* Steven Moffat updating a Victorian classic with some weird twists. James Nesbitt and Gina Bellman are outstanding in it.\n\nIf you did the *Buffy* thing, but never hit *Angel* or *Firefly*, you might want to give those a try.  We're all praying anything like a DVD/Blu-ray release will happen with *The Nevers,* given how S2 was only released on **linear** FAST.\n\n*The Expanse* might hit the sweet spot for you. It's up on Amazon Prime, but also out on Blu-ray if you need physical media.\n\nAnd I adored *Person of Interest* (which has complete series sets in both dvd and blu-ray)*,* watching it weekly on CBS broadcast. It is as the kids say these days, a slow burn, as it takes roughly 2/3 of the first season to slowly change from a victim-of-the-week crime procedural-with-an-AI twist to an SF show about AI with a victim-of-the-week twist. :D  Showrun by Jonathan Nolan, now of *Westworld* fame (earlier of *Momento* and Batman movies with his brother Christopher Nolan).\n\n*Black Sails* has [surprisingly affordable complete series sets](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Sails-S1-S4-Collection/dp/B07G19F9T3). Given that it's left Hulu and is back as a Starz exclusive, this may be the preferred way to get your pirate fix.  Again, a slower burn as it takes roughly half a dozen episodes for the Michael Bay excesses to slough off and reveal the writing underneath. But from that point on it just gets better and better. This is the show I'll hand to folks who want something similar after running out of *GoT.*\n\nNo media release yet, but *Moving* on Hulu is a  superhero Kdrama based on a superhero webtoon. It's pretty much its own thing, but it also supplies a ton of the stuff we've been missing from MCU releases of late. The showrunner is the webtoon artist, Kang Full. It's also the #1 Disney+ show in Asia ahead of all the MCU and Star Wars stuff.\n\n\\--edited to fix typo on Harlan Ellison's name \\[facepalm\\]",

Great story and good animation.\n\nNeed recommendations which are are not animated or cartoony but not difficult to watch. I don\u2019t want to slog though Severance or Succession. Both of them were not enjoyable to watch at all. Severance felt like torture. Succession was just one long story plot. Just boring and uninteresting. I gave up on Silo and I almost never give up on a TV series.\n\nDrama Shows I do enjoy watching are The Twilight Zone (1959), The Wire, Better Call Saul, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Game of Thrones (you know before it went south), Rome, Fargo, For All Mankind, Patriot, Justified, Slow Horses, Mad Men and many more \n\nComedies like  After Life, Acapulco, Dave, Hacks, The Office(UK) Ghosts (UK and US), Abbot Elementary, Friends, Parks and Recreation, Will and Grace, Scrubs, Pysch, Cheers, Blackadder, Yes Minister, Yes Prime Minister, Only Fools and Horses You get the idea.\n\nAnimated Shows: Avatar : The Last Airbender,  The Simpsons, Batman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League, Samurai Jack, Primal etc.\n\nRight now I am kind of done with the animated series for a while and need more Comedies and Dramas with real actors with a script. No reality shows.",
