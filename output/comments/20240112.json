I'm really enjoying this season.\n\n**Monarchy (Apple)** \\-  Strong finish to a show that I almost quit on. I started to lose interest around episode 5 to 7, but it started to get better, especially in the finale two episode. I actually got a bit teary-eyed during the finale. I was not expecting that. The return of a certain character really made for some moving scenes in the finale.\n\nThis show was really up and down for me but overall I liked it. If the show can fix some of the issues with the younger characters (like stop them from bickering all the time), I think next season should be better, similar to how S2 of the *Foundation* improved upon S1.\n\n**True Detective S4 S1 (MAX)** \\--  I'm conflicted. What does everyone think? I think I wanted to like it more than I did, but I enjoyed it enough that I will continue to watch.\n\nThe show has a ton of elements that should make me like it: mysterious artic research station, reminding me of the the *Thing* horror movies. The small town vibe with odd characters, reminiscent of a *Twin Peaks* and *Northern Exposure.* I also enjoyed the exploration of an indigenous culture through the framework of a detective mystery.\n\nAt the same time some of the imagery and dialogue just seemed to be used for effect only, to shock you with its weirdness, like the show was force-feeding its strangeness on you. It's still early days though so I still have hope. Jodie Foster's performance was great and I liked the character dynamic of her family, all of whom work in the same police station.\n\n**Criminal Record S1 E1 (Apple)** \\-- the premiere of this British cop drama was entertaining enough that I'll keep watching. This first episode mostly established the main mystery and the two main leads so it's hard to tell if this show will standout in comparison to something like the excellent *Slow Horses* but there's potential.  So far, I do like Peter Capaldi's performance as the intimidating veteran Chief Inspector.\n\n**Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple)** \\-- not a TV show but this film is now available for streaming on Apple. Despite it's length, I watched it in one sitting. I enjoyed it and I was happy to see Scorsese can still make great films, as he still uses film in inventive ways (like with the ending), but story-wise, I wish there more of an exploration of the other Osage Native American characters.",

I wonder if it would have benefited from a 2 episode premiere to really get into it.\n\nTrying to watch this show without holding it up against the standards of the first season is difficult to do, and it didn't grab me in the same way that did.\n\nLots of characters introduced and an interesting enough central mystery, but still unsure.

So not too shabby. The documentary is centered around Corbell and his personal trajectory, and it offers a bit of a sneak peak into it. I personally can only thank these guys for 1) Doing their homework 2) Keep pushing for the truth 3) Getting their asses on the line by doing so. I also liked how the show doesn't pull any punches in the way they -especially Corbell- speak their minds. Meaning, no censorship in their emphatic use of the language. Meaning you hear some fucks and shits. So yeah, I would recommend this to any human being on the planet Earth who has access to it.

The series is a clever and successful reinvention of the classic literary character Sam Spade, now set in 1960s France.\n\nClive Owen gives one of the best performances of his career, playing an older Sam Spade aware of his mortality. The story unfolds with a philosophical depth that is rare in television series today, valuing dialog, character development and broader themes about life and morality.\n\nThe series manages to be both an engaging narrative and a deeper reflection on human beings and society. For those who appreciate series with substance and a mature approach, \"Monsieur Spade\" is an excellent choice. Definitely worth a look.",

Didn't find a single flaw with it. \nAnd the last 3 episodes are one hell of a ride, what a masterclass in suspense and editing. \n\nFeels like a classic already, despite being barely 2 years old. Season 2 can't come quick enough, I hope they don't fumble it. But they earned our trust with S1. \n\nIf you make a trial for AppleTV+, you'll binge it on the spot ;) for the reminder of the trial, check out\n\n-Black Bird (Taron Egerton undercover in a Prison)\n\n-Defending Jacob (Chris Evans as the father of an accused murderer)\n\n-Silo (Rebecca Ferguson trying to find out how the world ended)\n\n-Slow Horses (Gary Oldman as a smelly secret Agent)\n\n-Ted Lasso (you heard about that one)",

That part was sooo good!\n\nBut then, yeah, the plot was kind of incoherent.\n\nYou raise great points, but I had a related though slightly different one about the logic of the plot.\n\nMy big problem with it was that the Boxers and others raise a really good question: why have Triads/gang life at all? In other words, why are we rooting for the violent international gang?\n\nThe show *could have found a way* to thoughtfully answer the question, for instance, to show that marginalized communities don't have police looking out for their best interest, so they have to use illegal violence to protect themselves and their families and their businesses. But the show *also* wanted the cops to be good because of lady cop.\n\nSo in the end, we get *zero* explanation for why we should be rooting for this gang, and spoilers >!at the end, one of the brothers goes back to help his mom run the gang, so its not even like we managed to get *him* out of it!<. It was dumb. It is dumb and nonsensical to have the \"bad guys\" have a better take on the situation than the good guys, unless you are going for Breaking Bad, which they clearly weren't. They just hoped that people wouldn't think about the logic of the situation for more than two seconds.",

My biggest complaint is that being a gay man is not being \"feminine\" or a \"woman\" and that feels really stale and dated and icky to me every time they make a \"Mary\" joke. Also the sheer *amount* of jokes that rely on a gay sex pun are overwhelming. \nHowever, the sets! Swoon! The set dressing and film and clothing choices are terrific. I find the leads charming and fun. While 5-6 episodes in a row is about all I can take of \"oh go juggle your balls! or someone's!\" it's a fun rewatch. \n\n**Sneakerheads** on Netflix. I love sneakers and am very interested in the culture. This show is...okay. I rate it a \"C\". It feels like a YouTube commercial for the store Fight Club in L.A. It's not terrible, but after 3 tepid episodes I tapped out. The fact that a reality show about collectibles is more riveting than this is saying something. \n\n**Law and Order: Criminal Intent** (Peacock). I fall asleep to \"Murder Death Kill\" as my husband calls it. The sounds of screaming, crying, squealing tires and gunshots is somehow soothing I guess? Ha ha, it's just a very talky show and I know most episodes of the Mothership and SVU by heart. I was avoiding CI because I recalled it being 85% interrogation room scenes (which it is about 60%, I was not entirely wrong) which I don't like. But wanting something new, I started on season 1 and am enjoying it! I didn't recall they had tons of different leads, not just Eames and Goren, so that keeps it fresh.",

Beautiful animation and great period details from Edo Japan, only marred by a protagonist whose plot armor makes John Wick look like Forrest Gump, which almost became a fatal flaw, especially by the movie's climax. \n\n**Scavenger's Reign Season 1**(Fubo TV Canada/Max) Another adult-focused adult animation, this is a show I more found interesting than fully loved. I'm a big written SF fan, and in particular love Jeff Vandermeer's Area X trilogy, and was interested in this show's take on the survivors of a crashed spaceship and the complex ecology of the planet they land on. Well-drawn characters and a decent narrative arc but the multiplicity of characters and flora and fauna in the show felt a bit too scattered at points. A worthwile show to watch but not unmissable. If you are looking for an incredible take on humans encountering alien ecology, please read the Area X trilogy (e.g. the Annhilation movie).\n\n**Slow Horses Season 3** (Apple TV). I was surprised how much I was waiting for the new season of this show. I don't think Slow Horses will every be considered a hall-of-fame show but with the great acting, clear stakes, typically gorgeous Apple TV production, and well-drawn characters this show just flies by and we easily finished it in one night. Slow Horses has always had a bit of a third act problem, with the world's most boring car and plane chases being features of the first two seasons, but this season might have been the worst with a hugely maximaist last two episodes that are really out of character for the premise of the show, e.g. the U.K.'s most inept secret agents. \n\nMuch like Blue-Eyed Samurai, shows need to keep their narratives and protagonists somewhat grounded in reality in order to generate narrative tension and I hope Slow Horses dials down the unbelievable herorics of our heroes as well as some characters that are bordering on self-parody but this is a very enjoyable and breezy show to watch overall.",

There's also a lot of playing with cultural references, stereotypes, social constructs and such. Which is nice. The show's basically a punk version of the late 70's-80's American sitcom, so there's a lot of subverting those tropes, but also lots of embracing them. They keep the facade, they have fun with the innards. And it feels very much like opening up McFarlane's head and peaking inside, from the music, to the themes, to the personal observations. I personally enjoyed it in the overall but I found it a bit too much at times. Meaning all the sarcasm, irony and borderline-cynicism, all the 12 jokes per minute thing, all the amazingly clever and witty come-backs (which come mainly from Ted, but also from the cousin and from the kid protagonist), all the unnecessary -in my eyes, that is- rough language. That all got me thinking about how using too many \"fucks\", for instance, cheapens the whole thing for me, and now we are all are at the level of a 13 yo. Fucks should be used wisely, or they lose their effect. It also made me think how the comedy that I love is not so much reliant on speech, but rather what the characters say comes from the conflicting circumstances at hand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Finding your roots.** I watched the episode with Brendan Fraser.

All I'm saying is a new system would be nice where we could have 1 comment thread per show where people can reply to and upvote that comment to talk about a show. That way I don't have to scroll through hundreds of comments of people talking about the same 2 shows for weeks on end. That's just a solution off the top of my head but maybe there's a better one.",
