The London plot was much more fun to watch than the Clanton plot so hopefully S2 goes with what works more.  7/10\n\n\n***Under the Banner of Heaven*** on FX/Hulu: Ridiculously good mini-series about the murder of a devout Mormon woman and her child in Utah in the '80s. The series also explores the formation and spread of Mormonism in the United States and dives deep into LDS history. Wyatt Russell and Andrew Garfield both deliver strong performances.\n9/10",

Just great.  Can't recommend it enough.\n\n**The Righteous Gemstones** has also taken an interesting turn toward character development with BJ, Judy's rather vanilla husband showing he has some balls.  I have not laughed so hard at a full frontal fight scene since Blake Edwards' Skin Deep (Google it. It's hilarious).  And watch The Righteous Gemstones because this season is really leading, I hope, to some real growth for the Gemstones - or some payback - whatever.  Always funny.\n\nSo, my husband loves **Shark Week.**  Loves nature shows and documentaries so we decided to do some Shark Week pre-gaming by watching previous shark week stuff and after about three of them we were like \"Are these the same sharks?\"  \n\nYes.  Pretty much.  If you go back and try to binge Shark Week you figure out they only have about three hours of footage and information about sharks.  They stretch that out into 15 hours padded with re-enactments, jump cut dive footage and three different scientists all saying the same thing about sharks next to a celebrity who looks like he does not know what a shark even is.  \n\n Lesson learned: Shark Week is not super bingeable but still fun to watch.",

This last episode may have been the craziest episode yet.\n* **The Righteous Gemstones:**  \ud83c\udfb5 THE REDEEMER! \ud83c\udfb5\n* **Justified City Primeval:**  I think Boyd Holbrook is the standout in this show thus far, but trying to live up to the incomparable Walton Goggins is a monumental task.  Timothy Olyphant is still great as Raylon Givens, but fans of the original may not be completely satisfied with this revisit.\n* **Quarterback:** Your enjoyment of this will be directly related to how much you like professional football, and more specifically how much you like Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins, and Marcus Mariota.  As someone who lives in the Kansas City metro, this is practically required viewing.\n* **Secret Invasion:**  This one, for me, unfortunately, falls into the somewhat concerning and lengthy list of recent Marvel TV shows (and the MCU as a whole) that has been disappointing post Endgame.  I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be The Americans, but I was at least hoping for something akin to the underrated Spy Game (or keeping it in the MCU, The Winter Soldier), but it\u2019s been nowhere near that.  A waste of Samuel L. Jackson.\n* **Black Mirror:**  It\u2019s been kind of hard to get into this season of Black Mirror.  We\u2019ve only watched the first two episodes.  They\u2019re both very well done, but we just haven\u2019t binged it like in years past.\n\n*Finished*\n\n* **The Bear:**  I\u2019m so sad this is already over.  One of my favorite shows of the year.  Fishes and Forks are probably two of the best episodes of TV this year, for vastly different reasons.  The second half of this season (from Fishes on) was incredible.\n* **Silo:**  I\u2019m glad that they did not go with the usual cliff hanger ending, but still left you with enough questions that you want to come back to it whenever it returns.  Probably the strongest science fiction show of the year.\n* **Platonic:**  This ended up being enjoyable.  Rose Byrne and Seth Rogan have such a weird chemistry together.\n\n*On Deck*\n\n* **Reservation Dogs:**  I had no idea this was ending at the end of this season.  This is such a fun show.  I can\u2019t wait for it to come back but I\u2019m sad it\u2019ll be over soon.\n* **Physical:** Speaking of Rose Byrne, this is coming back in early August as well.\n\n*Bonus Cartoon Corner*\n\n* **My Adventures with Superman:**  It seems like this is somewhat anime inspired (both in terms of animation and plot), which means it may not be exactly for everyone, but thus far I\u2019m loving this show as they\u2019ve really nailed who Superman is and what he\u2019s about.  I\u2019m also only three episodes in and I\u2019m loving the characterization of Lois as well.",

It's tongue in cheek and self aware to the point I wasn't sure it was actually a reality show. But aside from the arch narration and very...T Mobile ad set ups at times it's cute. Skip the stagey and forced \"introduction to the city\" stuff at the beginning and just go straight to the matches and Date Zero stuff. \n\n**Quarterback** on Netflix. I put this on as background TV but found it too distracting so I'll have to watch-watch it. It's interesting and compelling tv for those that like sports or those that enjoy \"behind the scenes\" stuff. \n\n**And Just Like That** Season 2 (Max). I mean...this show has us where they want us. They very well know we are ride or die for the characters and set up. It's a 50% improvement on Season 1 but there's still so many issues with the show. The fashion is overall better (although I still have many, many issues and quibbles) and the tone is lighter and more fun and more classic SATC, but it's got a long way to go. \n\n**Real Housewives of NYC new crew** (Peacock) I mean...I would die for Jenna Lyons. I'm fascinated by her and would watch an entire TV show about her, although I suspect she's not quite dramatic and extroverted enough to carry a whole show. I *adore* her and want to be her. I want every single thing in her apartment including her. She's got grande dame energy and I'm here for it. \n\nIt's very telling to me the reaction on the Bravo subReddit of \"she's cold, she's a snob, she's a terrible person, look at this dirt we found from when she was CEO\" because she's not a hot mess express who's also conventionally feminine and beautiful (although I find her stunning) and she's aloof and cerebral and dry/understated.\n\nI find the other women tolerable, if not as compelling. Erin is giving me Jill Zarin vibes, Sai is cute and pretty with not much of a storyline (and has children named London Scout and Rio Dash I MEAN), Brynn is on my last nerve and it's not cute, honey, Ubah is high energy and personally I find that irritating but I can see how she balances the cast, Jessel is the one to watch. She's as they say \"delulu\" and clearly detests her husband who she pretty much needs for money. Also is her child named Rio as well? Cut it out ladies. \n\nI *need* more episodes stat. The first episode was a much-needed breath of fresh air and had just enough silly drama, fashion, NYC skyline and glamour, and cheeky, zingy energy. Love it.",

The second season feels more erratic than the first which had a clearer aim. Glenn Close is a great addition, although her presence makes some of the less stellar performances more apparent.\n\n**Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 8)** \\- catching up with the final season of this. Was always going to be a struggle making a cop comedy show in the wake of 2020, but it's good that it at least tried to address this tension. Some of it works, some not so much. Still good for a laugh between the more political moments.\n\n**The Bear (season 1)** \\- rewatched in preparation for season 2 and it hit much harder this time round. An intense binge but what a great show. I'm glad to hear the second season slows the pace down, not sure I could take this show at 100 all the time.",

Probably going to be a while before season 3 with strikes so maybe should have savoured the episodes a bit longer. \n\nNow watching Enlightened. Trying to go back on a few older shows that I never got the chance to watch. It\u2019s entertaining but season 2 is where the show really shines. It\u2019s a shame it never got a 3rd season. I\u2019m surprised it never got more post white lotus love. \n\nWeekly I\u2019m watching:\n\nAnd Just Like That. I think it\u2019s an improvement on the first season but still not reaching the heights of the original show. \n\nThe Crowded Room. This has dragged on a bit too long when it wasn\u2019t even perfect to start with. Probably my least favourite Apple TV show I\u2019ve watched so far. \n\nMore on Apple TV, Hijack and The Afterparty have been fun. Even if I have to suspend my disbelief for some parts of Hijack. \n\nI realise every week writing these that I watch too much tv",

I think the main issue is the constant plot holes and continuity. Also the realism factor is a big one. There are a lot of action sequences that are ridiculous and non-realistic.

The lead detective Bosch doesn't have nonsensical gun fights with thugs in every episode.  When they send DNA evidence to the lab you don't hear about it until the end of the season and sometimes it leads nowhere.  You actually see the cops doing paperwork, looking at photos and talking to neighbours.  \n  \nLet me give you a perfect example of the difference between this show and most other cop shows.  One of the detectives walks outside and sees a $100 bill on his windshield.  He walks over to it and then gets shot.  He hits the ground bleeding, drags himself to cover, calls for help and passes out.  SWAT shows up and takes him to the hospital.  No gun fight.  No firing rounds at the snipers position.  No fictional horeshit.  They are up at the scene THE FOLLOWING DAY looking for evidence. Every other show on the fucking planet, the lead character would vow to take them down in the hospital, the downed cop would wing the guy before he passed out and they would be tracking that SOB down in ten minutes.",

It's not good, worse than season 2. It just feels like Netflix is doing their main fantasy series on the cheap. There is only 1 short monster fight per episode (in a TV show about someone whose job it is to kill monsters) and most of the content is just witches and wizards banging on about politics to pad out the episodes. I also felt that in terms of language and music it just felt too modern, not like an eastern European fantasy. Dandelions and Ciris characters just felt mopey and melodramatic. Cavill and the guy who plays Dijkstra are pretty good though but not enough to redeem the show. So far without part 2 being released I'm going to give it a probably generous 6/10",

I didn't like it ending on a cliffhanger bc it felt so contained as I was watching it but that is a more minor complaint. Will def watch season 2\n\nReacher - Never planned on giving this a try bc it looked bad but a friend said it was good so I gave it a shot. Made it about 20 mins in and stopped. It felt cheaply made and the acting was....not great. Was immediately not a fan of the guy playing Reacher and if you don't like the main character of a show like this there is really no point continuing. \n\n1923 - Not quite finished this series yet but it has been very good so far. Sheridan continues to mostly deliver with his shows. Not a big fan of Tulsa King and Yellowstone hasn't been as good as it was at its peak but 1923 is hitting all of the right notes. \n\nDark Winds - One episode left and I will finish just for completions sake but everything about this show is mediocre. Not a lot of great performances and the plot is just okay. I also think it is weird how it has super natural elements to it that don't really seem that important to the people they are happening to.",

Well, I think episode 4 was ok-ish. I mean, there are a few problems going on here. Imo Marvel has not handled the character of Nick Fury properly, going back to the Captain Marvel movie. They tried to make him likeable or something, and the origin story for his losing his eyes was crap. The Nick Fury from the comics was a warrior, basically. So there's that, and the fact that Sam Jackson is 74 yo. And it shows in each one of his movements. Then there's the scope of this miniseries, which is way bigger than it's able to cover, especially in 6 episodes. Also, the creators of this piece presuppose that there's some type of emotional connection between the viewer and Talos and the Skrulls, which at least in my case, is non-existent. And then there's really silly and ridiculous dialogues and situations.\n\nThe **Gemstones**' finale was ok. I'm not so sure this has been the best season so far, as someone pointed out. It had its moments. I also realized that Danny McBride always plays the same character.\n\nThe tv movie **Invincible: Atom Eve**, was ok, pretty much in the same vein as the show Invincible. That is, a gruesome and interesting take on the genre. I wonder if they really need all the gory stuff.  I mean, the characters and the stories are compelling enough imo.",

Every scene feels catastrophic because every single camera shot is 'artfully' shot from behind objects and people. Camera half blocked by a door frame. Camera half blocked by a plane seat. Camera out of the room, behind a plant, shooting through a glass door. Once you notice it you can't stop seeing it. It's either that or the camera is WAY too close to actor's faces. Let the damn scenes breathe.\n\nThe sound mixing is trash. Every actor is mumbling or speaking too low. I don't have this issue with any other TV series. Watching with subtitles is a must.\n\nI don't know any characters names. I'm like 5 episodes in. This shouldn't happen.\n\nScenes/storylines that go nowhere:\n\n* The pilot & Idris talking through the game's chat. What was the point of that? Had zero impact on the show. The co-pilot about to talk to the ground to initiate a landing. \n\n* She had a secret plan to speak Hungarian to alert them the plane was still hijacked. Lady hijacker is on to this, says \"say this one and only line in Hungarian. Nothing else\" So she can know if she says anything else in Hungarian she's trying to alert them. Co-pilot does it anyway, nothing happens, lady hijacker doesn't care? And the ground spoke English anyway so why was it even needed? \n\n* Hijacker proceeds to bleed out for an entire episode, finally collapses from blood loss, yet somehow an INK PEN IN THE CHEST revives him and he continues to live for another hour? Its like they forgot he was bleeding out and that was the main issue the whole time.\n\n* The whole blank bullet bullshit. What a joke. You're telling me they got on the plane with real guns but loaded them with blanks? Why? It's not like the blanks suddenly made it easier to get them on the plane. And then they switch them out with real bullets anyway, but not a full clip, nope they switch them out one at a time lolol wtf\n\nI could go on and on. At this point I hope the plane crashes into the intelligence building and takes out every character and I can move on.",

What was the point of that? Had zero impact on the show. The co-pilot about to talk to the ground to initiate a landing.\n\n- shows the main characters ingenuity and that's going to be protagonist of the show. he's not a 'normal' passenger so we expect to see him lead. basic trope; wake up. \n\n\n>She had a secret plan to speak Hungarian to alert them the plane was still hijacked. Lady hijacker is on to this, says \"say this one and only line in Hungarian. Nothing else\" So she can know if she says anything else in Hungarian she's trying to alert them. Co-pilot does it anyway, nothing happens, lady hijacker doesn't care? And the ground spoke English anyway so why was it even needed?\n\n- did you even watch the show? she says the line. they keep replying back to each other. that hijacker (who i bet you want to know is named Kim for storyline purpose) is showing she's timid, she doesn't follow through. we see this later on with the tropical shirt hijacker who becomes calm cool collected when shit hits the fan. that girl clearly doesn't want to do any of the killing herself so what's she going to do? does she know what \"affirmative\" or any other action is in hungarian? you shooting her on sight since this is realistic to you? \n\n>Hijacker proceeds to bleed out for an entire episode, finally collapses from blood loss, yet somehow an INK PEN IN THE CHEST revives him and he continues to live for another hour? Its like they forgot he was bleeding out and that was the main issue the whole time.\n\n- got me there doc as not sure where they'd go to help a lung out, but are we counting minutes? what's an entire episode? but they're simulating pneumothorax which would be a similar type of operation for something in the lung. are you relying too hard on your movie tropes to think this would be in the throat? sure that part sucks but its essential to the story, we can suspend disbelief that maybe the doc didnt help him, maybe the doc killed him, maybe they lied? do you enjoy any aspect of drama? \n\n> The whole blank bullet bullshit. What a joke. You're telling me they got on the plane with real guns but loaded them with blanks? Why? It's not like the blanks suddenly made it easier to get them on the plane. And then they switch them out with real bullets anyway, but not a full clip, nope they switch them out one at a time lolol wtf\n\n- again, if you actually watched any of these episodes, you'd realize the hijackers were forced into this and do not want to do it unless pressed. the blanks are there for intimidation, and if there's a fuckup, they (only the boss) get serious; the girl you ignored said numerous times this wasn't the plan, but you want her to shoot the pilot for speaking hungarian. the normal bullets are explained later in episode 6 which again I can tell you didn't watch. \n\nhope this helps pal. it's a fuckin _fictional drama_",
