                    "body": "I've seen all those shows. \n\nI'd say in order, I'd place *Twin Peaks* in first place because it's the most unique and experimental.  The first season is iconic but you have to also watch the uneven second season, then the movie *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me* (which is underrated IMO), to get the 3rd season, which originally aired on Showtime, and it's absolutely spectacular. \n\nThe Showtime continuation of *Twin Peaks* is the most wild show I've ever seen. It's a weird mix of horror, humor, sci-fi and pure zany weirdness. Seriously, in some episodes you'll be laughing your head off, in others you'll be gripped by the strangeness and the horror of it. \n\nAfter that, I'd go with *Six Feet Under* or *The Shield* or *The Leftovers*. \n\nIf you want some fast-paced with tons of melodramatic drama go with *The Shield*. It's a very addicting cop drama so you'll whiz through the episodes. \n\n*The Leftovers* is a great high-concept show but it does take little while to build things up.  If you like it, I'd also recommend creator Damon Lindelof other show, *The Watchmen* (but I'd highly recommend reading Alan Moore's classic *Watchmen* graphic novel first, it's a masterpiece). \n\nIf pushed, I'd suggest watching *Six Feet Under* first out of these three shows. The characters are all great, and it has a very satisfying finish as it wraps up the storyline of this family connected with the funeral home business. \n\nI put *Boardwalk Empire* last, even though I really liked the show but I thought it was a bit uneven at times, especially in the later seasons. One of the main cast members leaves unexpectedly, which creates a vacuum in the show, so it takes awhile for the show to find it's footing again. I will say just like in *The Wire*, the 3rd season is really good.  There is this one very sympathetic character, and the finale of season three is absolutely epic. It felt like a homage to a very famous film by Scorsese -- which is no surprise since Scorsese himself was also involved with the show.",

I enjoyed the running joke of how incompetent everyone is, but my only qualm was how the detective was WAY too annoying at the beginning. But if you had the same problem, keep going, cuz she gets waaaay better starting episode 4 and actually became an enjoyable character by the end lol.

Great humor, fun and easy to watch and as with most sitcoms, the story may not totally grab you at first but you grow to love the characters.

I started watching it as a background noise type of show but I quickly fell in love with it and it earned my full attention. The humor really landed for me and I actually really enjoyed ZD here. 9/10 for now, but possibly fron receny bias\n\n**Yellowjackets** - I had binged season one very hard, but realized at the end of the season finale that it was going to head in a direction I no longer liked. Season two was a huge slog for me to get through and I was pretty much hate watching by the end of it. It felt like a bait and switch between seasons. Christina Ricci is great though.\n\n**The Mandalorian** season three - I was pretty disappointed with season three and I feel it has abandoned all the parts of it I used to love. I enjoyed the show a lot more when it was more like a weekly adventure than just one season-long story. I simply did not care about the season three plot at all. Star Wars fatigue is definitely setting in.\n\n**Silo** - I liked it for sure but I'm still a bit mixed. The premise for this show appeals perfectly to me so I was always going to enjoy it. My main issue is that the first two episodes are great and the last episode is great, but everything in the middle is a very slow burn in comparison. The pacing and use of narrative hooks were so strange to me. It makes me curious how the books tell it. 8/10, waiting to see where season 2 goes\n\n**The Bear** - I feel tricked by this show, in the best way possible. Everyone always tried to sell it to me as an accurate depiction of working in a restaurant and I really expected just a drama with chefs, and in a lot of ways it is that, but it's also so much more. Season one was gripping and episode seven was a masterpiece.\n\nI was skeptical of the direction of the plot in season two, then *boom* they hit me with 'Fishes', pure chaos and the only episode of the show that actually made me feel really uncomfortable and anxious. Just when I'm recovering from that episode, *boom* they hit me with 'Forks', a deeply emotional and touching story that probably also works on its own. For me, this episode makes it into my pantheon of best single standalone episodes of any TV show.\n\nI was so hesitant about starting this show but it deserves its hype and if anything I felt it was *underrated* even despite the accolades and critical acclaim. I'll concede that some parts are a bit contrived, but it's a minor criticism in comparison to all the good things this show offers. An easy 10/10 for me.",

I liked season 1 a lot more than most people did, but I kind of feel the opposite way about season 2. Don't get me wrong, it's really good, but there's people saying how it's one of the best seasons of sci-fi ever and that feels a bit over the top for me. Absolutely worth watching though, it has potential to top The Expanse for best recent sci Fi if it can continue to improve - 8.2/10\n\n**Dear Child** - chilling. It has a realism that really makes it scary while being slightly unrealistic. Good ending but felt slightly rushed - 7.9/10\n\nStarted:\n\n**Harlan Coben's Shelter** - never heard of this writer before but watched the first episode. Reminds me a bit of Stranger Things season 1 (the only season of it I watched) but may just be because they are both small town YA mysteries. The first episode does end on a darker note than anything I remember from Stranger Things which is a plus to me. Good pilot, has potential to be very good or very mediocre depending on how the mystery unravels. Hopefully more of the former as it is based on a book after all - 7.5/10",

You probably have already seen some of these.\n\n* Mindhunter\n* Chernobyl\n* True Detective\n* Yellow Jackets\n* Sharp Objects\n* Squid Game\n* Alice in Borderland\n* Utopia (original UK version)\n* Sandman\n* The Terror\n* Mr. Robot\n* Babylon Berlin\n* The Returned\n* Black Bird\n* Barry -- seems like a comedy but it CAN get very dark at times. It can also get very meta too, playing with different genres.\n* Expanse -- the first large story arc is a mystery which has elements of space horror, so that should appeal to you. Later the show stays decidedly space-opera as it switches gears (like to space western) but it's still a great show.\n* Watchmen\n* Leftovers\n* Penny Dreadful\n* Ozark\n* Twin Peaks  -- get to the fabulous third season and it gets very stylized and dark (alternating at times from intensively unnerving to laugh out loud funny). Absolutely peak television\n* The Queen's Gambit -- not necessarily dark, but it's very stylized in its presentation of the 1950s and 60s, and the main protagonist otherworldly talent at chess depends on a lot of her ability to have strange dreamlike visions.\n* The English -- also not necessarily very dark but it is very stylized in its depiction of the Old West populated by eccentric characters. It reminded me of a less violent Quentin Tarantino film. Really funny and underrated, starring Emily Blunt. It's on Amazon Prime.\n* Signal (Korean or Japanese remake) -- really dark mystery cop show with a walk-talkie that can talk to the past, and it has some very intense moments.\n* Border -- the Japanese TV series that features a cop who can see the dead, and later is trying to catch a serial killer.\n* Kingdom -- zombies in feudal Korea. It's a really good show.\n* Six Feet Under -- about a family who runs a funeral parlor and while not necessarily dark, the show does deal with death a lot and it's a fabulous family drama show.\n* Hannibal\n* Black Mirror\n* Fargo\n* Orphan Black\n* Bates Motel\n* Foundation -- even though this is sci-fi space-opera, this is a very visual show and season two was terrific TV. I've seen many fans of Dark like this show because of its high concept ideas.\n* Jessica Jones -- only watched the first season and the story gets pretty dark)\n* Daredevil -- again a pretty gritty show, since this was also a Netflix show)\n* Loki -- not dark but has retro-futuristic 60s/70s aesthetic that makes the show unique, plus it's great zany show.\n* Andor -- a mature take on the Star Wars universe. Features a lot of dark settings and there is a real sense of espionage and intrigue like from classic spy thriller films.\n* WandaVision -- initially plays with the sitcom genre in an inventive meta way and then the show veers off in an unexpected direction that can get very intense at times. Despite it being a superhero show, I thought some scenes were worthy of Emmys.\n* Boardwalk Empire -- since you like Perry Mason, many of the people behind Perry Masson first worked on Boardwalk Empire. It can be an uneven show in the later seasons, but the first three seasons were really good.",

There is some loss of life and sadness but you're also watching something grand and majestic unfold as you continue to watch the show.  It keeps the Golden Age of Sci-Fi sense of optimism from the books, but modernizes it for today's audiences.\n\nWhile Creator David S. Goyer has 4-season and 6-season plans, he hopes he can do a full 8 seasons to really explore Asimov's *Foundation* universe (and maybe even part of the *Robot* universe).  I hope the show grows in popularity so we can see that come to fruition.\n\n**For All of Mankind S1 to S3** \\-- I watched all the seasons as I waited for the *Foundation* S2 finale.  Aside from a few odd plot lines that had me scratching my head, I really enjoyed this \"what if\" sci-fi show.  I really got nostalgic when the show advanced a decade each season and started playing some of my favorite music from my youth. Can't wait for S4 to start in November!",

The production quality was top notch, felt like a movie (specially season 1), and both seasons were excellent, as different as they were between each other (season 1 was more mysterious, atmospheric with a slow pace, while season 2 was more straightforward and the pace was considerably faster, with a stronger second half of the season).

I was sure I wouldn't cry through the finale, I cried. It is *incredible*.\n\nNow, do I have a few critiques? Of course. The season borrows very freely from multiple classics, including Death in Venice, Cruising, Angels in America, The Band Played On and Philadelphia. The finale especially in part I has a particular type of lighting on a lingering shot of an empty hospital bed that is VERY 90s TV special, I suspect on purpose. Sometimes this borrowing feels like a loving homage and a \"hey, I get that reference\" moment, other times more of a pastiche. The entire last episode is 70% narration, which is both good and bad. Ryan Murphy is well known for absolutely whiffing it on his finales and wrap ups and this one does not. But in order to make the pieces fit and explain some stuff, he resorts to Exposition Galore in the form of narration. More than once he does a Ghosts of Christmas Past trick to show a backstory and make a point, it feels creaky the first time and downright irksome the second time. He also brings back a ghost more than once, when the first or second spotting would have been sufficient, and more impactful. \n\nBut oh! The impeccable *American Psycho*-esque art dealer's apartment! The slant of light on Fire Island as the sun goes down--not just on that day, but on the free love and fun of the 70s. The early 80s costumes! The music! The bathhouse that feels like the chicest possible version of \"The Backrooms\"--a nowhere and everywhere room in an unassuming brownstone. The A-list actors having a blast! It's all amazing.\n\nOne thing I found very interesting that other creators have tiptoed around when discussing the AIDS epidemic is the violence and wild/amoral sexual behavior that came before it and how dark and upsetting uncontrolled male sexuality with no limits could be--how an appetite for sex could mingle with violence so easily and be so rampant. It can feel disrespectful to the victims of AIDS to talk about the risky sexual choices that many made in that time period because it feels like victim blaming, but there is a horror in how closely tied the lust for flesh and blood are, particularly in men, and Ryan Murphy nails that here. \n\n**Queenmaker** on Netflix, a K-drama. Someone described this as \"Succession from Karolina's viewpoint\" and that's apt. It's a glossy, slightly silly in the way all K-dramas are, soapy look at a powerful family and the women that fall victim to their greed and carelessness. 2 episodes in it's good, it's not blowing me away or anything, but it's fun.",

It's so interesting to see what a completely different filmmaking/superhero comics culture (Kdrama/webtoons) does when influenced by the MCU. But I don't think we'll ever see a flying superhero gunfight in an MCU movie. :)  I loved that they even had a post-credits epilogue/build up for the next season (if they get one). I also adored that the webtoon writer/artist (Kang Full) was the writer for the tv series, and even got to slip in a callback to an older webtoon of his (*Timing*), set in the same world. \n\nHighly recommend this one if you want something superhero / spy / romance with some high school bully drama; can deal with subtitles, are okay with a 20-episode season, and a lot of bloodshed.  Right now, this is the most expensive KDrama ever (65B won, about $48M) due to the huge amounts of cgi required, beating out *Arthdal Chronicles* (54B won; about $40M) and *Squid Game* ($24M). And it's also Hulu's most popular Kdrama at the moment. Netflix must be kicking themselves for not grabbing it. :D\n\n***Reservation Dogs: \"Elora's Dad\"*** \\[Hulu\\].  That was some surprise casting. :D  So sad we've only got one more episode. Been a great ride, though.\n\n***Only Murders in the Building*** \\[Hulu\\]. I'm loving this season. I'm even loving the musical numbers. \n\n***Welcome to Wrexham*** \\[FX / Hulu\\].  The boys are back. And the show is doing its usual meandering stroll through the team, the town, and the Hollywood guys. Not a typical sports documentary. \n\n***Winning Time*** \\[HBO/Max\\]. I am so ticked off this was cancelled just as we're getting to high points of the Celtics/Lakers rivalry of the '80s, and that band-aid edited-together \"ending\" was annoying. Everything about this show: writing, acting, directing, cinematography is on-point.  And as a non-sports viewer, I find it kind of miraculous they got me to care so much.  I may have to go rebinge *Legacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers* on Hulu to get the cancellation taste out. \n\n***Ahsoka*** \\[Disney+\\]. Having a great time. But there are only two more episodes to go, which makes me wonder just how compacted the last two episodes are going to be. \n\n***Archer*** \\[FXX / Hulu\\]. Same old same old. I just need to note that it's been so *not*\\-fun being a Spectrum cable customer having all the Disney channels go bye (except for ABC) then having them return sans FXX (*Archer)*, FXM, Freeform, Disney XD *(Star Wars: Rebels)*, Disney Jr (*Bluey*!), and NatGeo Wild (*Extraordinary Birder)*. At least I can apparently now finish out *Archer* on the VoD.

Probably my only new broadcast scripted drama. They've only got 10 episodes. But it'll be fun to see Jesse L. Martin as a lead after all those years playing the dad on *The Flash.*\n* 9/27. \\[short film, 45 min.\\] [*The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RdncisZ_QA) \\[Netflix\\]. Wes Anderson directs and adapts a Roald Dahl short story. Cast includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Ben Kingsley, Rupert Friend, Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel, and Richard Ayoade.\n* 9/28. [*Starstruck* S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_LuFClHETk) \\[Max\\] Rose Matafeo's romcom-subversion show is back!\n* 10/1. *Bob's Burgers* S14 \\[Fox\\]. Actually all of the Animation Domination block is back, except for *The Great North.* [*Krapopolis*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjAP_hNWy84) took its spot. This is the new Dan Harmon *(Rick & Morty)* show that's been renewed for three seasons already. It premieres 9/24.  Not my taste, though.\n* 10/3. [*Found*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cccG9NNXCew) \\[NBC\\]. Possibly also not my taste, but as all my usual broadcast crime procedurals are not happening... also interesting twist on the let's-consult-a-serial-killer trope.\n* 10/4. [*Quantum Leap*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo4eB6rZeeE) *S2* \\[NBC\\]. Yes. NBC is the only Big Three network that did off-schedule development and has new scripted fare for the Fall.\n* 10/4. [*Magnum PI* S4B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGwW5RgIKrM) \\[NBC\\]. Spoiler in the trailer.  We finally get the last 10 episodes. Thanks, NBC for saving the show only to turn around and cancel it.\n* 10/5. [*Our Flag Means Death* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fVBD2ltBw) \\[Max\\]\n* 10/5.

Finally we get the last 6 episodes.\n* 10/12. *Transplant* S3 \\[NBC\\]. We finally get the season that aired last fall on CTV. But at least now we know NBC will be getting S4.\n* 10/15. [***Pantheon*** S1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_HJ3TSlo5c) [**AND S2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4zqd3k3yg) \\[!!\\] \\[Amazon Prime\\]. Holy shit.

[*Annika* S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDsMFMB17FA) \\[PBS *Masterpiece\\]*\n* 10/18 & 10/25. *Nature* (PBS) is doing Australian ABC's [\"The Platypus Guardian\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mFcUOZSqA) and BBC's [\"Spy in the Ocean\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LITlLW9bYNs) (the nature doc where they disguise cameras inside robots)*.*\n* 10/27.

Baz Luhrmann expands *Australia* into a six-episode streaming series.\n* 11/10 \\[movie\\]. *The Killer* \\[Netflix\\]. David Fincher.\n* 11/12. *Beacon 23* \\[MGM+\\]. Can't believe someone rescued a Spectrum Original. It's an SF/thriller starring Lena Headey.\n* 11/14. [*Murder at the End of the World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnPl4PuNb5U) \\[Hulu\\]\n* 11/16. *Julia S2* \\[Max\\]\n* 11/17. [*Scott Pilgrim Takes Off*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ompoD7V42DM) \\[Netflix\\]. Even looks like the Lee O'Malley comics.

They really could have added a few more episodes to S1 and called it a wrap. Gave up a few episodes into S3. Might see if I can push thru this weekend so at least I can know how it ends... or just read show recaps and be done with it.\n\n2. The Morning Show - saw it was trending on Apple. It feels like a compilation of a bunch of movies and shows I've seen before, and especially after watching Firefly Lane. I skipped one show which was an entire flashback... I get tired of those. I dunno if I'll hang with it or find another show to watch.

Just my luck that Netflix find a new hit fantasy show and I\u2019m not much of a fan! \n\n**Justified: City Primeval** - Not quite as great as the original series but it was still great to have Raylan and Justified back on TV! It was fun but I definitely missed the support cast of the original show especially the Crowders and Bennetts. I did enjoy the Boyd and Winona cameos at the end. Hopefully we get a future limited series following Boyd! \n\nThe other weird thing that stood out was the actress playing Willa Givens. She did not seem a natural especially with the vocal aspects of performing. It felt like they gave her a bunch of episodes then cut down her role in the show after it was not working out. After I finished I was not surprised to learn she was Timothy Olyphant\u2019s actual daughter! \n\nNext up I\u2019m probably going with **Wilderness** or **Foundation**.",
