Also love that Anthony Mackie is getting projects made in New Orleans as I think the city is such a great backdrop for things.\n\nSecret Invasion: went in not interested, ended it even less interested. Except for the crazy ways this kind of screws up some stuff in the overall MCU.\n\nStrange New Worlds: still love this cast.  I watched the first few eps of Lower Decks in preparation for the crossover and wow they did a great job (especially loved the meta jokes about the differences between animation and live action performances).  \n\nBanshee: Only a few episodes in.

Yesterday I finally started and finished watching it and I absolutely loved it.\n\nFirst of all the presence of Park Chan-wook directing the shit out of the show is felt in almost every scene, from the camera movement, to how information and actions are presented, revealed and recontextualized, to the look and feel of the costumes, sets and *striking* cinematography. This show is one of the greatest examples of how much a director with a vision can do to elevate a story past what viewers may expect by having watched dozens of other shows in the same genre. Watching the first episode and thinking \u201cah yes I\u2019m in great hands\u201d is particularly great with a show because you can settle in for the next 5 hours of story being meticulously and deliberately unfolded.\n\nBut fortunately the amazing direction can build upon a very good script and great performances, especially from Pugh which is probably at her best.\n\nI\u2019m still buzzing with excitement with how much I liked it and hoping more will discover it because I\u2019d dare say it\u2019s a true Hidden Gem\u2122",

The K-pop scene might be one of the best things ever to appear in Star Trek, however. Quick question: Why is the *USS Farragut* always dropping off Lt. Kirk, yet we never meet its captain?\n\n**Hijack**: I agree with the general consensus. Engaging and suspenseful, but the plot is kind of silly upon retrospect and there were too many hanging threads that didn't pay off. I feel it could have used a bit more polish and another episode.\n\n**Foundation**: Only one episode into season 2, so I don't have much to say yet.\n\n**Fisk**: Started watching this Australian legal comedy at this sub's recommendation. It's pretty entertaining so far.\n\n**The Rig**: I like thrillers that take place in isolated locations, so I thought I'd give this a try. It's not bad two episodes in, but I'm worried about it turning into horror schlock like *The Strain* and *Helix* did. At least the actors are top-notch.\n\n**The Afterparty**: Fun and inventive, as one expects from Lord and Miller.",

The finale was a little weak but still enjoyed to overall and it\u2019s only 7 episodes so really easy to binge. 6.5/10\n\n**Witcher S3:** I was really excited for this one but this season was just boring, it didn\u2019t need to be split into 2 parts. I enjoyed the first episode but after that I just kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. They tried to add more politics and scheming into this season, which I usually like but it wasn\u2019t done very well, felt very simple and empty. Henry Cavil was good and plays the character well but I still don\u2019t think that was enough to save this season. I doubt I\u2019ll watch the next season unless the reviews and audience scores are really high. 4/10\n\n**The crowded room:** I really enjoyed it overall, it was definitely slow in the first couple of episodes but the last (5 episodes) half of the season was really great. I think they handled a lot of very heavy themes with a lot of empathy and care. All the cast did a great job and the acting overall was the highlight of the show, especially Tom holland's performance, I really liked him in 'the impossible' and 'the devil all the time' but this was easily the best acting I've seen from him. He also gets more to do in the last 5 episodes. I think it would have worked better as 8 episodes, maybe take the first 5 episodes and make them 3 and keep the last 5 as they were. After finishing it I get why they did it the way they did but the first few episodes were too slow in my opinion. There were some writing choices I didn\u2019t like and some pacing issues in the beginning but overall a really good limited series. 7.5/10\n\n\nNext I\u2019ll probably watch Lioness (paramount+) or the new season of Baki (Netflix). Also wanted to watch the Americans, just found out all seasons are on Disney+ heard great things about that but just never got round to checking it out.",

                    "body": "**Evil** has some pretty decent horror type chills/scares, and some possessions. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Haunting of Hill House** was pretty decent as well--it definitely met that horror itch for me at least. It was a fun to watch late night in the dark, with popcorn and red wine type of show! \n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlso... One that people here don't like too much, but I REALLY enjoyed was the more recent **Locke and Key**. \n\nSure Locke and Key isn't going to win any big awards, and it's writing is more for a teen audience--with them making constant \"bad decisions\" plot weakness issues... \n\nBut I like a lot of horror for teens, and it was just a fun watch, waiting to see what the various keys would do. For me it was absolutely worth my entertainment time. \n\n(I wish there had been a few more keys in the mix, causing more magical antics and mayhem!) \n\nBut ya, overall I liked some of the aesthetics of the way the special effects were done, the general horror vibe of the show, and also the filming location. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nAnother one I liked, but not many here liked was **Devs**. \n\nIt definitely has a spooky ominous vibe throughout, and has some slight SciFi time travel themes which I enjoyed. \n\nPeople didn't like the acting style of the leading actress--which they thought was monotone and subdued--but from my point of view, not every leading role has to be done in a histrionic over the top, in your face stand-out fashion!\n\nI like a variety of acting styles, so I really enjoyed her portrayal as a change/shift compared to some other shows. \n\nAll in all... Devs is kinda like watching a long episode of Outer Limits or something like that from the 90's. \n\nAgain not spectacular, but just a fun mix of intrigue, horror and Scifi. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Archive 81** had a very similar-intriguing horror vibe to it, likewise also involving some SciFish time-travel twists. \n\nIn fact... I'd say Archive 81 was probably better than Devs, but either way: if you like one of these, you'll probably enjoy the other, vice-versa. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Walking Dead Season 1** is also probably worth a watch. \n\nBut it's not a deep psychological intriguing scary type of horror... \n\nIt's more like a gory, violent, unsettling, axe-in-your-face, type of horror which isn't always my favorite type, but Season 1 at least was still pretty fun. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n**American Horror Story Season 1**\n\nIf you never saw it, probably very much worth a watch. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nOne recent one I wish I hadn't bothered watching and investing time in however was... **Servant.**\n\nIt had promise of all kinds of crazy supernatural or SciFi things about to happen on the horizon, but then it just kinda dragged out and out... and nothing all that interesting/mesmerizing ever really happened! \n\nAnd the tone was overall very constantly \"uncomfortable\" but not in a fun-horror way. \n\nI mean... it wasn't as fun for me at least, as some of the other horror shows I mentioned above. \n\nBut... then again, quite a few people here liked Servant, so who knows: you might like it. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nSo ya... that's about all that comes to mind... at the moment. \n\nI think I typed waaaay too much above! So will stop here. \n\nAnyways, I'll check back to this comment thread however to see if others have some good recommendations I'm missing out on!",

The episodes have been pretty good, but almost every episode feels like it should take place in a 24 episode season.  It's been mostly back to back character spotlights without any room to let the characters breathe while they do their normal stuff.

Set against Australia's breath-taking, natural landscape, and with native wildflowers and plants providing a way to express the inexpressible, this enthralling family drama spans decades. \n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt9174718/plotsummary?item=ps7357619\n\nI'm currently three episodes in and it's one of the best things I've seen all year. A hauntingly beautiful, captivating slow burn. The acting, cinematography and storytelling are all top notch. Well done Amazon. And well done for actually funding an Australian story and production and not completely Americanising it (like HBO did to *Big Little Lies*).",

Agonizingly slowly, but getting there. \n\nEdit: okay, I tried \"Special Ops: Lioness\" (what a *terrible* title!) or as my husband describes it \"Hot Chicks...but in WAR!\" it was a very enjoyable, totally unbelievable show. It reminds me of the scene in Columbiana (also with Saldena if I'm not mistaken) where the character who is a hardened assassin from the favelas of Columbia celebrates a kill by doing a bump and grind dance in her underwear *sucking a lollipop* in front of the mirror. I could be slightly misremembering that, but you get the idea. I had to FF through the very unnecessary extended torture (bleh) scenes. Honestly, I'd watch an entire show about just Cruz infiltrating the world of ultra-rich Arabs. The secondary character that she befriends is a tad stereotyped but very interesting and I want to spend more time in her world.

One that stands above and beyond the rest as well as inspiring many remakes from other countries is Bron Broen. Sweden also has a crime thriller called Snabba Cash\n\nGermany has some good tv, probably their best is Dark\n\nIsrael and Korea are the last two bigger budget countries that put out tv. \n\nThe former has many above average shows such as When Heroes Fly, one very popular action show Fauda, and one very prestige but not talked about show Prisoners of War (it's the show that inspired Homeland, so you'll see many similarities between it and the first two seasons of Homeland)\n\nKorea has many popular kdramas, but I'm not a big fan of them because of the overacting and cliche plots. Some recent good ones without those two negatives are The Glory and Bloodhounds\n\nKorea makes much better movies than tv imo, so if you want to go that route, there are many dark mind-fuck movies from them that are very good such as Oldboy.

Like he commands authority whenever he appears during the scenes. \n\nI don't know if it's the age thing, but I can no longer binge-watch shows like I used to. Before, I could finish a whole season in a day and a series in a week (maybe less depending on the length). But now, I can barely watch an episode or two before I lose focus.

Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of charm, the cast is great, and as a non-treky it has peaked my interest in exploring the franchise more. However, this season is very hit-or-miss. It fluctuates between mediocre and pretty good episodes, even some of the praised episodes I don't get (the Toronto episode only features 2 characters, 1 of which has 0 character growth because it's a different timeline, the episode also plays out like a generic police drama). The main character is barely in the show, the new officer, Pelia is barely in the show, they kind of tease Ortega getting a bigger role but she ends up not, Sam is barely existent, they tease Uhura getting a bigger role but she is only prominent in 2 episodes. 2 seasons in and the only character that feels fleshed out is Spock, I want more from an ensemble cast. although I have a lot of complaints, I'd probably put it around a 7.5/10, the highs are high and the lows are still middle of the road.\n\n**True Detective - Season 3 (Rewatch)**: I initially had this season pretty high but felt soured by the ending. On a rewatch, knowing how it plays out, this season becomes even stronger. I would easily call this an all-time great season of television. The nuances of the characters and how they evolve through life and the case, how it's all framed from Hays' POV while he struggles to piece his life together while suffering from dementia, the uncertainty around the case, the juxtaposition between the characters, the masterclass performances from Mahershala Ali, Stephen Dorff, and Scoot McNairy. Just, wow. For a very grim series, when you read between the lines you end up getting a very satisfying and positive conclusion. Pizzolatto leans very hard into the \"2 guys talking in a car\" meme that came from the 1st season. I think the only reason S3 is not endlessly brought up like the 1st season is because of the drop in momentum from the lacklustre second season (which I think if it wasn't called True Detective it would have been received well, but it's hard to follow up one of the best seasons ever with something that's just decent). The 3rd season manages to capture the character study magic, and multiple-thread complexity without faltering like the 2nd season, but it does lack some of the jaw-dropping moments. 9-9.5/10\n\n**King of the Hill - first watch, currently at season 3**: I've rambled a lot, so I'll keep this brief. This show is hilarious. The characters are surprisingly deep for a cartoon, and unlike most cartoons, there's quite a lot of growth, only 2.5 seasons in. Similar to Bob's Burgers it's a very wholesome yet realistic take on a regular family, but it also has absurd stories to shake it up every few episodes. Probably a 9/10 excited to see more!",

Love the premise of Severance and the writing and performances seem really solid. Also idk if Ben Stiller directed the whole show, but I was surprised to see he directed the first episode. Silo is also really well made. The world building in the first episode as well as setting up the plot and building the paranoia hooked me instantly. I didnt realize it was based on a book I read years ago (Wool from the Silo series) so now I'm totally locked in. \n\nDidn't love : Shrinking & Ted Lasso\nGave Shrinking 3 eps and Ted Lasso 4 and neither were for me. They're not particularly bad, just a little too lighthearted and \"sitcomy\" cheesy for me. \n\nLooking forward to :  Foundation & Servant. Servant has gotten great reviews and there's 4 seasons so I can't wait to dig into it. \n\nIf anyone has any other Recs please let me know, I have 2 months and 3 weeks left lol",

Haven't seen season 3 yet and it can feel a little preachy at times but overall heartwarming and fun stuff.\n\n\\- **Black Bird** would be my second go to. Probably somewhat influenced by the fact that I think Taron Egerton is one of the best actors doing it but yeah. He gets in trouble with the law and instead of a regular stint they put him in with the psychos so he can try and draw a confession out of a killer. \n\n\\- **Silo** would be my number 3 and you already started that one. \n\n\\- **Defending Jacob** takes the 4 spot. This one is Chris Evans and his kid is accused of murder and you spend the showing wondering if he did it or not. Conclusion wasn't as satisfying as I would have liked but the show kept the mystery of it all up pretty well\n\n\\- **Truth Be Told** I only watched the first season of this. Octavia Spencer and Aaron Paul. She has a true crime podcast and is exploring a case where she helped put Pauls character in prison but then new evidence comes out so she goes through that. A little slow at times but good performances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome quick thoughts on others. \n\nShrinking had some fun moments and good performances but again, if you aren't looking for that I get it. It was definitely cheesy at times and had some flaws. \n\nSee with Jason Momoa I tried an episode or 2 and it wasn't for me. I am also just not a fan of his. Don't think is a good actor. \n\nSlow Horses is covered in the name. I watched the first season and thought it was kind of slow. Didn't particularly like any of the characters either. Bland all around IMO.\n\nEcho 3 another mediocre one I watched. Some performances that just didn't work for me and the plot was just ok.\n\nSeverance you are already watching but IMO one of the more overrated recent shows. I got into it because the premise was interesting but in the end I thought it never really delivered on anything too exciting so it felt flat and a little dull.",

They like to subvert expectations: on season 1 Imperioli's character was pretty much the straight man and the moral center of the piece, until, well, he wasn't anymore.

I'm also low key offended by the \"dumbing down\" of the story for an audience the creators don't think can comprehend a more complex or nuanced plot.  So maybe my anger at that has colored my viewing a little bit, but not a lot, I don't think.  I think they surrendered some potential to maybe give it a broader appeal, even though the first season was very complex and still extraordinarily popular.  I don't understand how show runners can be gifted really great source material, talented actors, and an almost limitless budget and still shortchange the viewer.  If you make a good show, people will watch it.  I almost wish this had been a movie franchise with 4-5 movies instead of a series - but whatever. Cavill killed as The Witcher and I'm glad I got to see that performance.\n\nEveryone has mentioned **The Righteous Gemstones** and I'm going to mention it as well.  This season was fantastic.  Really bingeable.  I didn't binge it - we watched week by week - but having watched the whole thing, I know if I sat down to watch the whole thing again, I would watch it in one sitting.  And for much of that time, I would not be able to move because I would be laughing so hard.  The additions of Kristin Johnson, Steve Zahn and expanded role for Skyler Gisondo, really launched this season into the stratosphere.  Everything about it - gold.",

The actors are solid - I'm not a fan of Mackie's but his performance isn't bringing the show down.  Writing is sufficient.  It's just missing a spark of some kind.  My best guess is that it's down to camera work and direction - those two pieces needed to bring more energy, but instead they brought \"filming a Sunday drive\" energy.\n\nI'll say one thing I noticed for sure was that I would have had more fun if I was watching on a setup that had better sound than just my tv speakers, but I don't think this was the deal breaker at all.",

The plot is crazy the show centers around a mad scientist who essentially opened a portal into another dimension and stole a version of his son after his died from a horrible incurable disease. This breach into another world caused a lot of fucking bizarre shit on both sides.  FOX wanted it X-Files-ey so they do a mythology episode every three or four episodes.  So for a few weeks the mad scientist and his FBI agent have to try and stop some monster of the week problem, and then there's some fucking bonkers ass mythology episode that is just god damn insane.  \n  \nIts got a great cast, Anna Torv, John Noble, Joshua Jackson & Lance Reddick.  The sci-fi shit is well done and bonkers.  Its got some very great stand alone episodes one of the first episodes features a fucking were-porcupine. Also John Noble plays the mad scientist and hes constantly high on LSD doing crazy mad scientist shit in his lab.  Hes hilarious in the show.  \n  \nOne thing I will say (and I don't give a fuck who disagrees with me) you cannot binge Fringe.

That said, I have heard some really high praise for this and it isn't all that. It is good but it isn't anything close to things like The Last Dance.\n\n**Twisted Metal** \\- It was a good fun watch but some flaws kept it from being truly great. For me (maybe a bit more subjectively) there were just too many characters I wasn't quite into. John Doe was fine, Agent Stone was good, and Sweet Tooth was awesome but there was nobody else that did much for me. The characters are a little too over the top and weird for my tastes (which I guess they are sort of meant to be). The biggest offender though was that I didn't like Quiet or her brother and she had a significant role.\n\nI also think the plot could have been handled better. They did manage to flesh out a lot of the characters but getting them all together for the end didn't quite feel earned. Particularly Sweet Tooth. Seemed like he just kind of came out of nowhere to throw a wrench into everything to get his character more involved.\n\nLast little thing is I thought the vehicle battles were one of the better things they did and could have used more of that. The setup for season 2 was awesome and is actually very intriguing.\n\n**The Flash (movie)** \\- I know not tv but figured I would add it in since I have watched them all around this same time. I knew going in this movie probably wasn't going to be for me because I think Ezra Miller is terrible. Couldn't stand him in Justice League and this was him again, and even worse him times 2. That being said, I still wanted to see how the movie was and honestly even if you replaced him with someone even remotely likable I still think they movie was just decent. Nothing really stood out about it and the animated version handled it much better. I feel like I saw a lot of praise for Supergirl leading up to this and I don't understand that either. Not to say she was bad but her role felt pretty limited. Didn't seem like there was much there to talk about.",
