Season two was pretty sloppy, and it was a poor decision to a) give it 16 episodes, and b) split the season into two halves. I believe the viewership fell off a cliff after the mid-season finale, probably because most folks didn't realize the season re-premiered a few months later.\n\nI was thinking about it, and with a couple tweaks, and a couple more seasons, I think it could eventually become a cult classic, feel-good comedy. There's so many fun relationships in the show:\n\n* Harry and Asta\n* Harry and the kid(s)\n* Asta and D'Arcy\n* The mayor and his wife\n* The sheriff + deputy\n\nI really hate the \"larger threat\" to Harry that gets shoehorned into each season to add drama. I don't want to see Harry evading discovery and capture from shadowy government agencies or other alien species. I just want to watch a fish-out-of-water dramedy where it's about Harry and his relationships with the townspeople. And maybe *occasionally* about some of them discovering he's an alien, and the hijinks that ensue. But mostly about Harry learning about what it means to be human. That's where the show shines.",

I never watched it because I thought it was just some B-rated walmart clone knockoff with a bunch of boring soap-opera plastic characters. Maybe it's because my bar was so low and didn't think i'd make it through the first episode. But I am LOVING it way more than I thought I would. It's a brand new show to me, and done WAY better than I was expecting. I know, here comes the \"dOnt gEt toO ExCiTed iT staRts tO sUX aFter sEasoN nuMbeR bLah\" comments. I'm preparing myself for a nose-dive in quality but I'm still just enjoying it for what it is. \n\nAnother thing. Being a standard all things zombie fan, have seen Dawn of the Dead (2004) a billion times. I always thought it would be so cool to see what would happen after they took off and tried to survive on the yacht at the end of the film. So Fear TWD hooked me even more. \ud83d\ude0e Posting this just in case anyone is in a similar viewing situation and always put it off like I did.\n\nALSO, I've been loving Tokyo Vice and am now somewhat used to the japanese subtitles. I'm wondering if I should finally give Kingdom a shot with the subs. Or is it not worth it?\n\nrandom, but is Peaky Blinders something everyone should watch at least once?",

The first episode or two has to do a lot of world building but after that the plot moves fairly fast, so most of the dialogue is fairly brisk from what I remember. You shouldn't have a problem following the subtitles.  I really loved the characters in that show. It's like the Korean version of Games of Thrones but with the undead, and things get pretty epic.\n\nIf you like it, I also recommend checking out Train to Busan, which is also Korean and also on Netflix. It also deals with the undead, but set it's in modern times. It's a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. A great action film. I think there were sequels but from I understand the first one is the best.\n\nAnd yes, Peaky Blinders is good.",

An interesting premise but so completely ineptly directed and written that a lot of online discourse focused on whether the show was depicting a simulation or not. \n\nI feel like this show is the opposite, it looks gorgeous, individual scenes make sense on a narrative and conceptual level and characters actions are mostly understandable. However, the premise is so silly (marriage but both are secret agents!) that it would have taken a real threading of the needle for the concept to work, especially over a full season of television. \n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith, instead, mostly disposes of the spy story by treating it as an goofy and disposable plot device and focuses on the relationship between the two leads while throwing in some social observations about life and dating. The result is that neither aspect of the show really works, the action scenes lack stakes or tension and the relationship is so artificial that it isn't particularly compelling. I don't think this is the worst thing ever made but after an exciting pilot we eventually stopped watching around episode 4 or 5. \n\nThis show seems to be a hit and is one of Amazon's valued IPs so we'll probably see more of it but it's such a thin concept that it's very hard to pull off successfully, in my opinion anyways. If they would have taken the action/espionage more seriously I think there was an interesting show here, but this iteration is not for me.",

Felt like it gave a really good feeling about living under a brutal occupation (in this case Nazis in Paris) and a rainbow of ethical choices people make to either survive, to risk one's life by resisting, or to fall somewhere inbetween.\n\n2. There is a  great scene were fashion designer Coco Chanel is basically threatened if she does NOT go to meet a group of top Nazis at a restaurant, and at first she is anxious and dubious, but when one of them mentions a competitor designer she gleefully takes them down and you can see the 'switch' has turned and she will be complicit.\n\n3. Sometimes I don't care for Juliette Binoche but she is great playing a 'character' role. I don't know how french people will feel but I think Ben Mendelson is very believably 'french' in his body language and such. Dior's character is less well drawn than Coco Channel. For the first time in years I am not irritated by John Malcovich's performance, its nicely low key so far. Its really nice to see Maisie Williams in an adult role and entirely different character than in GOT.\n\n4. Great art direction and camerawork\n\nWhat did not bother me but seems to be a big problem for others.\n\n- I know in the past I have read about Coco Channel being a Nazi 'asset' but forgot the details - but after watching the first episodes I went back to see reactions about the show and some people are FURIOUS that she is not painted as a complete villain. All I can say is that IMO she is shown to be a terrible person turning on anyone to save herself. \n\nMy issue with the show:\n\n- Its called \"the New Look' but at least up to this point there is not very much about the actual process of dress designing. It is much more about moral compromises.  I feel like the title is misleading..",

Ben Mendelsohn and John Malkovich are two of my favorite actors (but ha, yes. Malkovich can be over the top for sure) & I\u2019m loving them in this, no idea how their accents hold up! \n\nI think the editing is a little weird, the end of episode 4 felt like a finale & the repeated flashback felt overdone \u2014 could have used audio and a shot of his face, or anything other than replaying the same scene like four times. \n\nI\u2019m enjoying it but probably not my top show of the year; another success from Apple TV so far, though.",

The sfx are also good (for tv without a GoT budget) and the set design in E1 was really good.  Music is ATLA music.\n\nCons: Always tough to have child actors.  They're not awful, but they could be better.  While accurate to the original, kinda wish they went with actors 1-2 years older (and maybe they'll be better for later seasons).  Sokka probably the best of the group.  Adult actors kinda struggling too, trying to find a balance between doing a live action version of a kids show and showing a genocide by fire nazis.  They also went very loyal to the original with the costume design... which kinda makes it look like cosplayers.  Weird dichotomy with they excellent, detailed set design and the really dark nature of the first episode.  Wish they went with more realistic design.  \n\nOverall, if you liked the original, I think you'll like this.",

It always looks like a big budget sci-fi production and the story is engaging and exciting. The Clone Dynasty stuff remains the best part of the show but I think this second season did a good job even with the characters and story arcs outside of that. I usually just praise Lee Pace as the guy is an awesome lead but I think the other two actors who play Dawn and Dusk are almost as compelling in their performances. Plenty of fun twists and turns over the season meant I was hooked on this show from start to finish. \n\nI slowed my usual watching pace so I could jump on both the official Foundation podcast and the unofficial podcast from the Bald Move guys. Both were great and probably enhanced my enjoyment of the show. Now I just hope Apple does not cancel Foundation after the bleak news of production on the third season being halted due to \u201cbudget issues\u201d in the wake of Argylle being the third $200 million bomb for Apple in theatres in less than 5 months. Stop making movies and get back to making big budget sci-fi TV shows! \n\n**Mr & Mrs Smith** - This was pretty much exactly what I was expecting from a Donald Glover Mr & Mrs Smith show with him and Maya Erskine as the leads. A bit of the glam of the movie and a lot of the character driven artsy comedy the two excel at. I thought it was a very solid and watchable show. Bit of a cliffhanger ending so they better renew it! \n\nNext up **A Bloody Lucky Day** and **For All Mankind**.

The negative reactions to it seem really over the top to me.  One feeling I cannot shake though: this is a story that is a bait and switch, teasing us with a big mystery about scientists dying in a bizarre way but ending up being about the murder of a Native American environmental activist woman, which I suspect is a storyline that would have have completely kept all the S1 Rust Cohle bros away.  Maybe that is also why there are (some of) those strong negative opinions over the story.\n\n**Masters of the Air Ep 5** - The series lacks satisfying character development and the nature of their part in the war (missions, then back to base) stops the feeling of progression through the war the way the previous series' had.  The return to base also breaks the build up of tension.  With Eps 4 & 5 though we are seeing some change in the tone as the losses pile up and ther optimism is being replaced with despair, so I'll be interested to see how the series changes.  Overall I am still enjoying it despite the shortcomings, but that may be in large part due to my personal bias towards liking the subject matter (the bombing campaign over Europe).\n\nFinished **Babylon Berlin S4** - Like previous seasons it has some storytelling issues, but overall I really love this show.  Noir-ish mystery, super stylish including a bit avant-garde, interesting time period, sexy and at times brutal, and so well made I get totally engrossed in the characters and story.  It does suffer the same fate as many ongoing shows with too many characters and storylines though.\n\nOn in the background so only semi-watched **X-Files S1** - I have seen these about a half dozen times, so they are as familiar as an old glove.  S1 has a number of weaker stories, but it's still fun watching the characters get familiar with each other and build up chemistry, and tio watch the alien conspiracy start to unfold.\n\nNext series to semi-binge: **Severance S1**",

I know this show is its own thing and doesn't resemble much of the original but that doesn't mean the writers had to stop themselves from producing something entertaining and worth investing one's time into. The story is sloppy, the dialogue is awful and the characters are too boring. Maybe it's the 8 episode format (compared to 13 in the original) that inhibits it from hooking me into wanting more. To each their own but don't get into this show expecting the return of the classic Justified formula. 6/10\n\nI did like **A Teacher (2020).** It touches on some really dark subjects within the tightly knit 10 episodes although could've spent more time to go in-depth to flesh out the characters. The first 5 episodes are fine but the execution of the remaining 5 leaves me wishing the writers had done more with the story than just summarising each event into 20-30 minute episodes. A worthwhile show that deserved a longer runtime and a much higher score on IMDb.",

You get a love triangle with 2 hot guys more attractive than the girl they're both madly in love with devolve into one throwing a pastry at the other in anger by the penultimate episode, you get the lesbian storyline, a recognizable actress as the mom, the sister who has more old school values than our lead leading to strained relationship, pop soundtrack in the background, etc. Same with comparing say the Night Agent ratings compared to Slow Horses, I don't think it really has anything to do with the content, it's just the service it's on.",

The Buccaneers did terribly even compared to other Apple shows. It got 2 seasons upfront and I see no scenario where it doesn't get canceled after.\n\nBut for your actual question -there's no way to estimate unique viewers or completion rate from what Nielsen provides or to truly compare binge vs weekly release shows. But Buccaneers would have had 300k ish views on debut whereas Queen Charlotte for its entire season had 25 million 'views' in its first 4 days and probably way more unique viewers.",

Season 2 is such a disappointment that I have started writing my *own book* out of spite (partly) because I feel there's a fascinating story there that Ryan Murphy et al are completely botching. \n\nCostuming/sets/set decoration: impeccable as always\n\nZingers/one liners: on point, funny\n\nActing: very solid\n\nEverything else is not where it should be, IMHO. \n\nStructure/writing/pacing/plot is OFF. I find the literal plot tough to follow and I'm someone who is *very* familiar with all these stories and plots. I find the choice to start post-In Cold Blood and at what sounds like the tail end of a long friendship and the beginning of what (to me) feels like a hard to describe behind closed doors \"feud\" to be a miss. The show seems to skim or skip over really key moments in favor of artistic license invented stuff (like the conversations with his now-gone mother, which others say they like, but I found a bit indulgent and jarring compared to the glossy and almost soapy feel of the rest of the show). \n\nI feel there are two very obvious and better choices that could have been made to make this make more sense and be easier to follow: \n\n1: Focus on a different \"swan\" per episode. If history dictates it, have other swans make an appearance or be side-plots in that episode. The fact that the directors and writers didn't go this direction with such huge star power baffles me. Each of these women has more than enough \"material\" to do 1-2 episodes about them. \n\n2: Go chronologically. Start off with the smash hit of In Cold Blood. Choose a set # of years for each episode like a 5 year period or something. Touch on the key events, show how they influenced the relationships and fallout.\n\nAnyway, do better, Feud. \n\n**Rosemary's Baby** 2014 with Sebastian Stan (!!) and Zoe Saldana (!!!) both terribly miscast. Everyone else in this show is perfectly cast and the costuming is divine. But this was an amusing misfire. It's a two-part mini series style show that I stumbled on. There's a...lot of things wrong with it from pacing, to clumsy updates, to a terrible wig, to outright acting issues. But it was mildly entertaining. My main issue is there is a relatively easy way to update this (look at \"Delicate Condition\" book as one example) with a \"mommy blogger\" angle to fix the SAHM/SAHW angle in the original and have that be a very interesting power fulcrum against which Guy is rebelling and colluding with Mr. Satan, but this show makes an odd choice to give the main character all his wishes *prior* to the birth of Damien/the AntiChrist, when it was my understanding that the reason Guy goes along with this evil plan is to GAIN all his desires. Confusing. Anyhoo, if you like cheesy nonsense, this is for you. \n\n**Dubai Bling** Netflix. I really tried to get back into this but something is just not clicking. It feels even more fake than your typical reality tv and I feel there's a lot of dancing around some awful, scary, upsetting realities in terms of the indentured help and slavery that goes on in the country, which is off-putting. Also the culture...aspects of it are really abhorrent to me as a feminist so overall maybe it's a miss, despite the fabu fashions and locations.",

The sets and effects are very good.  The Aang and Zuko actors are also both better than expected at the physical acting parts/martial arts stuff.\n\nThe biggest issue is the acting, which is partially to be blamed on the writing.  There are a lot of lines pulled directly from the cartoon that just don't work in live action in a show where they're showing people being burned alive.  The Sokka actor even tries to have the same cadence as Sokka from the cartoon and its a little weird.  Child actors are always tricky, but even good actors like Daniel Dae Kim don't come off great.  \n\nMy other criticism is the costumes, especially Aang's and some of the fire nation stuff.  They're clearly trying to be visually loyal to the cartoon.  The problem is that you've got cosplay like outfits in a realistic world with realistic effects and they look goofy.  \n\nI think the big problem with the show is that they're trying to combine some of the darker aspects of Avatar (like the holocaust of the air nomads) with some of the kid cartoon aspects (like Sokka's jokes).  Its a weird mix of the realistic with the cartoon.  \n\nStill enjoyable to me.",

I don't know how far I'll make it before the inexplicable drive to self-harm finally subsides for awhile.\n\nI finished that last season of Strange New Worlds over the last month or so. This is broadly the least offensive of the new Trek shows to me. The majority of the cast (with the exception of the actor who plays Spock and the one who plays the pilot, both of whom make my fucking skin crawl) is excellent despite having little to work with. Sadly, out of an entire season the only episode I liked is the one with the Klingon defector, and even then I felt it wobble. In the show's defense, it only had one episode I really disliked - of course, the Spock centric one. \n\nNow I'm watching Picard season 3. The de-age of Picard is the most terrifying I've ever seen. I highly encourage you to look it up if you want to see something painfully uncanny. What are people seeing in this that I'm not? I've heard this is where it \"gets good\", but it's still just as insufferably self-fellating in regards to its' characters while completely misunderstanding both them and the tone. \n\nIt's making me yearn for the comfortable mediocrity of SNW, and given me a deep appreciation for it's set design over Picard's truly fucking abysmal ones.\n\nI have just gotten to Ro Laren returning though. I hadn't remembered that she was played by the same actress as Helena Cain on BSG. Hearing her speak gives me chills, nobody plays intimidating as well as her. EDIT: Never mind she's dead already lmao",

He spent the first two seasons as a mildly incompetent very fussy old man passenger in his own show while the writers did...things.  \"The fucking hubris,\" really.\n\nS3 felt very different from the first two in that regard, at least.  He and the old crew have  failures and successes, they exhibit at least mild competence, and they finally seem to have some agency in their own show.   It's not the Greatest of all Trek, but it's leagues better than they've done in a lot of other places recently imho.",
