We just finished season 3 and can\u2019t wait for more!",

I would say the weakest point is the main characters' acting, but they are kids and have the capability of improving. If Disney sticks with the series, which I hope they do, I think the kids can refine their abilities just like the potter kids and carry the franchise further. \n\n*What If?* has also been a really fun season. Looking forward to the finale tomorrow. \n\n*For All Mankind* had a slower episode but it's setting the stage for a fun penultimate episode. \n\n*Monarch* this episode felt stretched, and didn't really do much until the last couple minutes. The 50s stuff is still the more interesting part to me, and I wish they focused more on that time period than the present.",

Even if you're done with superheroes check this one out. Great performances by Sandra Oh, J.K. Simmons, and Steven Yeun. Better still it does a great job of  combining the brutality of The Boys with a sincerity that feels earned. Excited for the next part of Season 2 (And don't forget to check out the Atom Eve special too!). \n\n**The Fall of the House of Usher (Netflix)** \\- This was my very first venture into the world of Mike Flanagan and it was beautifully depressing. It's a must-see for anyone, especially fans of Edgar Allan Poe. Certain parts do drag a bit and it can begin to feel formulaic at parts, but the dialogue and performances make up for any deficiencies. It's great to see Mark Hamill chewing the scenery too. \n\nStill watching:\n\n**Community (Netflix)** \\- I'm streets behind the rest of the world on this one (halfway through season 2), but I see what everyone has been talking about. I finished Rick & Morty a few weeks ago and wanted to check out more of Dan Harmon's work. It feels like a spiritual predecessor, though it's much less cynical about the world.

He said that **people can justify all sorts of horrible things if they believe the guy's heart is in the right place**. \n\nI was shocked because I never thought of it that way and I believe it applies to much more than TV.

This was a feature not a bug for those who went into the series having read Harris/seen the Hannibal Lecter movies :) and had been waiting for two seasons to *get* to the canonical stories, so reaction was a bit mixed depending on viewing background with the franchise.",

I did have fun connecting stereotypical tropes to other shows I\u2019ve seen a million times, but I laughed out loud every episode. My heart broke when >!Amy and Jonah broke up!< and I could not believe they chose that direction. I think they wrapped it up nicely for the bad hand the writers were dealt the last season but >!GOD I wish we could have finally seen the romance all 5 seasons built up.!<\n\nAfter watching Superstore I figured I\u2019d take on another  new sitcom I had put off, Animal Control. I saw the trailer when it first aired and couldn\u2019t get past, \u201cThis is Community if Jeff decided to work for animal control.\u201d But after enjoying Superstore way more than I thought I would, I decided to give it a shot. I\u2019m now on the last episode of season one. I found it to be a cute show, but so far it doesn\u2019t touch any of the others I mentioned above. Maybe it just needs to cook a little longer but I feel like it wasn\u2019t as laugh-out-loud funny as other shows like it, and a lot of the characters felt a little flat. Definitely will give season two a shot though!\n\nY\u2019all have any recommendations for what to watch next?",

Doesn't matter if you have seen the movie, just watch it.  One of the best shows of all time in my book.  \\[My Rating: A\\]\n\n**Slow Horses** **S3** (Apple TV+) - waited until all episodes dropped, which sucked of course for a few weeks, but now it's great because I can binge, binge, binge LOL. About halfway through \\[Rating: B+\\]\n\n**The Curse** (Showtime) - okay so I have been looking forward to this show for almost a year now, so I could not wait to start this one.  And wow it is everything I hoped for and then some.It would take too long to explain the premise and concept for this show, but I love it and recommend it all the time, esp for anyone who is a fan of Nathan Fielder.  For me personally I just love a show like this that is so unique.  I cannot even think of a TV show to which I would compare it, other than perhaps Fielder's last show **The Rehearsal** (HBO Max), which is also fantastic.  Fielder is a comedic genius IMO, and Emma Stone maybe the best actress on the planet right now.  If only there were more original and unique shows like this.  \\[Rating: A-\\]\n\n**Tulsa King** (Paramount Plus) - another show I put on the backburner for a few months, just never got around to watching it, so I decided to finally give it a try.  My expectations were probably a little low, but boy was I wrong as I ended up thoroughly enjoying **Tulsa King** very much. It is entertaining, with a solid cast, and quality production from Taylor Sheridan and Paramount Plus.  I have no problem recommending this, to anyone really, esp if you have nothing else to watch right now LOL. \\[Rating: B-\\]\n\n**Winter House/Vanderpump Rules** (Bravo) (guilty pleasure) - okay so not a series that gets discussed on here much (I'm sure there is probably a huge Bravo sub for that), but these shows (along with **Summer House)** are what I like to call my \"guilty pleasure\" shows, which admittedly is usually reality TV, and are shows that I am embarrassed to admit I love so much LOL.  What's crazy about **Vanderpump Rules** is these shows have been following the same group of people for over a decade now, yet they all still keep f\\*cking up...it's hilarious, they have all slept with each other and cheated on one another.  And it never ends it only gets worse LOL....cannot freaking wait for the new season of Pump starting next week. \\[Rating: C+\\]\n\n**Shows on the radar (next 2-3 months): True Detective: Night Country** (HBO Max: Jan 17) - writer/creator Nic Pizzolatto back again, with Jodie Foster as the lead, and John Hawkes to boot...COUNT ME IN; **The Regime** (HBO Max: Mar 3); **Three Body Problem** (Netflix: Mar 21); **Palm Royale** (Apple TV+: Mar 20); **Fallout** (Amazon Prime: Apr 12)\n\n**Shows on the horizon (6-12 months): House of the Dragon S2** (HBO Max), **Last of Us S2** (HBO Max), **Tokyo Vice S2** (HBO Max), **Severance S2** (Apple TV+), **The Veil** (FX/Hulu), and too many others....",

            "body": "Mostly animation and Disney-heavy for me this week. :)\n\n***What If...?*** **S2** (Disney+). Loved it, even though they've wandered away from the tradition of *What If...?* always being disconnected one-shots.  They're doing some continuing arcs through S2. They do acknowledge, though in the narrative. I also loved the Kahhori storyline, particularly  since it's Devery Jacobs (who we'll also see representing in *Echo,* too. The success of *Reservation Dogs* is yielding some really fun Native representation in the MCU). But the capper was them pulling in [Gaiman's *1602*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_1602) alternate universe. And the cel-shaded cgi look (as rotoscopey as it is) is really starting to grow on me, after this and *Blue-Eye Samurai.* Here's hoping they get a third season. Looking forward to the running gag of Bernard in Accounting getting used again.\n\nNot new, but doing a binge through of ***Star Trek: Prodigy*** **S1** (Netflix). The showrunners on this are Kevin and Dan Hageman, who have [the lion's share of story writing credit on *Trollhunters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunters:_Tales_of_Arcadia#Episodes)*.* They also roped in two other *Trollhunters*/Tales of Arcadia writers, Chad Quandt and Aaron Waltke. They couldn't grab A.C. Bradley, because she's head writing *What If...?* :D IOW, if you liked *Trollhunters/3 Below,* etc. you might like *Prodigy* and vice versa. IOW, Netflix is absolutely the best home for this show. Netflix has also grabbed the finished unreleased Season 2, and will be dropping it in 2024.\n\nThe basic premise of *Prodigy* is that on a prison planet without universal translation technology, a prison break has a motley gang of characters escaping on an abandoned Federation starship they've found: the *USS Protostar.* Aided by the ship's universal translator and a holographic Janeway, they begin to form as a crew/family and learn about the Federation, while fugitives on the run. So, not your usual Star Trek crew.\n\nAlso, still watching ***Spy x Family*** *S2* (Hulu). I'm sad we've left the cruise ship, but happy Bond got an episode all to himself.\n\nEnjoying ***Percy Jackson and the Olympians*** (Disney+) and ***Fargo*** *S5* (Hulu),  but feeling both are short-changing me a little on character and character development. Doesn't mean they're not good and worth watching. Just that we're thrown into the middle of things and heading into action set-pieces before I'm fully convinced why I should care about said characters. I'm happy to take it as read that I should, but would've been nicer to have that developed a bit more before all the fight scenes started. :D\n\n***Reacher S2*** (Amazon Prime). I'm still watching and enjoying it, but something about putting him together with his team has detracted from the lone wolf superhero thing that drove S1. I love seeing the team, though, and having women with a little more agency in said team. :D\n\nStill need to catch up on ***Transplant*** **S3** (NBC).\n\nComing up for me:\n\n* 1/4. [*The Brothers Sun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU8f8QrUCOM) (Netflix). They had me at Michelle Yeoh. :) First time I've seen Brad Falchuk on something that isn't Ryan Murphy.\n* 1/7. [*All Creatures Great and Small* S4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7lDeDdHYKo) (PBS, *Masterpiece*)\n* 1/7. [*The Great North* S4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjYVG02-fI) (Fox/Hulu)\n* 1/7. [*Funny Woman*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxsx50Tm7l0) (PBS).\n* 1/9. [*Echo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kddZsqjuWuo) (Hulu/Disney+) TV-MA. More *Daredevil* than *Hawkeye.*\n* 1/12. *Bluey S3C* (Disney+). Finally!  We can watch \"Cricket\". S3 will finish with [the 28-minute special, \"The Sign\"](https://www.bluey.tv/blog/a-28-minute-bluey-episode-is-coming-in-2024/) in 2024.\n* 1/14. [*Monsieur Spade*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUt7j_eXWOo) (AMC+/AMC/AcornTV). Clive Owen plays Sam Spade, retired to the South of France in the '60s. Showrunners are Scott Frank (*Queen's Gambit*) and Tom Fontana *(Oz, City on a Hill*).\n* 1/14. [*Belgravia: The Next Chapter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIye_NQeyd4) (MGM+). Not sure how a Julian Fellowes show is going to work without Julian Fellowes. Also, it's doing a \"next generation\" approach.\n* 1/14. [*True Detective: Night Country*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkL7cpG2UhE) (HBO/Max). They had me at Alaska and Jodie Foster.\n* 1/17. [*Family Law*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8doz-7h4TyU) *S3* (CW).  Jewel Staite, Victor Garber. Blue-Sky-ish Canadian legal family dramedy.\n* 1/18. [*Hazbin Hotel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSWVCwy88g) (Amazon Prime).\n* 1/21. [*The Way Home*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8KdBgny0k4) *S2* (Hallmark Channel). Canadian time-travel family drama. Where Chyler Leigh is killing it.\n* 1/25. [*Masters of the Universe: Revolution*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ucJLmGdHVg) (Netflix). Kevin Smith continues to let Mark Hamill voice Skeletor. :)\n* 1/29. *The Irrational* S1B (NBC). They're back!\n* 1/31. [*Feud: Capote vs. the Swans*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BzyTuQW8tk) \\[aka Season 2\\] (FX/Hulu). Ryan Murphy finally returns to *Feud* after six years. And with Tom Hollander playing Truman Capote? I'm so in.\n\n\\--edited to fix asterisks, fix a typo \\[Brother Sun-> Brothers Sun\\], and add that Hollander is playing Capote. And the \"Bernard in Accounting\" running gag mention (in S1, Black  Widow tried to set Peggy up with him; in S2, Darcy has codenamed him Puffin-1).",

S03E02 and most episodes after that (during that season) dropped off like a rock in quality and entertainment. The Mars landing portrayal was just... so dumb, and slapstick laughable at some points. It also wasn't well researched by the writers in terms of realism and elements that would be involved in a Mars landing. \n\nAgain, keep in mind that's just my personal opinion... but ya... I was pretty disappointed with a good chunk of the middle part of Season 3. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nHOWEVER... \n\nBy the end of S03, the last few episodes, it started to get really good and intriguing again, and the writing quality seem to pick up back to it's expected standards again. \n\nAnd going forward: I've heard good things about S04...

A show where police investigate a killer with so much representation, so many quotable lines, and a dirty little woman as the crass cowboy cop that breaks all the rules.  And there are consequences for those reckless actions!!!  Discussions on colonialism, misogyny, police violence, and homophobia.  Also it has Kevin the Seal!\n\n**Why Women Kill**: Terrible title, fantastic show.  I haven't watched the second season, I've heard it takes a nose dive, but the first season stands alone so that's fine.  The costuming, set design, and cinematography are stunning.  The plot is pretty strong as well and I enjoy the way the narrative takes detours, really teasing out who dies and why.  Unpredictable, often hilarious, remarkably tender, and I'm madly in love with Lucy Liu's Simone.\n\n**Murder at the End of the World**: Don't do it. \n\n**The Curse**: A mirror that I hate and can't stop thinking about.  Whitney reflects some of my worst qualities, which I know sounds like a weird recommendation, but hey if you liked Succession or Always Sunny this might be your cup of tea.  Both her, Ash, and Dougie are so terrible and deeply pathetic, it is amazing that the show can still cultivate sympathy.\n\n**Carol and the End of the World**: Deeply moving and so hopeful.  Animation can do some really creative and unique things that would be harder for live action.  \n\n**The Foundation**: The world feels really boring and empty (where are all the people? The scenes feels bare).  Also, the way math is treated is personally irritating, but my math teacher partner doesn't mind it, so maybe its my anti-religion bias.  And the dialogue, ugh.  I think the Three-in-one is cool tho, its too bad nothing else really caught my interest. \n\n**1670**: Really good, although I have minor subjective quibbles.  Nice to watch something in another language and the costuming/set design was fantastic.  I appreciate how many of the characters have rich interior lives.  Even watching it subbed in Polish it was still hilarious, credit to the writers and translators for their hard work.  \n\n**Fargo**: I doubt this needs another recommendation, but here it is anyway, this season is butt-clenchingly tense.\n\n**Slow Horses**: I felt season two dipped a bit but this season was great.  I am a sucker for shows about the police/government/spy agencies bumbling around.  I can't deal with James Bond and super cops and special forces, its so fucking annoying.  \n\nI've been on such a hot streak, no idea how I'll find something else that will measure up.

            "body": "Finished **Carol and the end of the world**. >!This is a curious show, in that the creators position themselves on both sides of the fence regarding the two main themes: the work environment as a cohesive and the YOLO path taken by a large part of the population in the face of impending doom. In the first half there's an exaltation of the workplace as a way of finding meaning, purpose, a steady habit. But then the series shows us that that doesn't mean that much if everyone on the team is disconnected from each other and just act like cogs in the machine. Same with the YOLO attitude depicted in the first episodes, it very much feels like they are taking the piss out of it, in a cynical way. But in later episodes there's a more lenient take on it, less abrasive, especially with the surf episode, or when they show the three-way situation with Carol's parents. So I guess my takeaway from this show is that Carol finally learned to open herself up and be part of a human fabric of empathy and respect (not only be a par of it but to actively create it). It only took the apocalypse. Lovely show, quite unexpected.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought that **What if?** stepped up their game in a major way with this second season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also watched 2 episodes of a Spanish 3 part docuseries titled **Ummo: La Espa\u00f1a Alien\u00edgena**, regarding a long-winded ufological case that started in the 70's in Spain. Well, the thing with this piece is that the thesis presented is clear from the get go, they don't think any of it it's true but a hoax. And so they go along with that and there's not one researcher of the case among the people interviewed on camera. There's several journalists, a movie director, etc. You know, I would have liked that they had someone who had done their homework properly, not just people giving their opinions. So yeah, kind of underwhelming.",

If you're not into Marvel obviously **SKIP**\n\nThere's 4 things I LOVE about this show:\n\n1. It allows the previous successes of the Marvel Universe to stand on its own.\n2. It allows for enjoyment in Marvel Stories WITHOUT the excessive Marvel Fandom and overanalysis of everything. Not everything needs to be a hint to Mephisto or some grand Epic Saga where everything connects.\n3. It allows for the creators to just do literally anything creatively. from fun and uplifting to dark and depressing endings.\n4. The is no obligation to keep up. each episode (mostly) stands on their own. There's a handful of sequel-episodes but generally it doesn't really matter which episode you watch or which you skip.",

Didn't matter if they never used the physique, skills or anything. Not even one convincing action scene. \n\nJust big man walks around awkwardly and a hilarious amount of people die without anybody calling in any real authority. Only two characters who were interesting were Roscoe & Finlay who won't be in S2 either. Meh",
