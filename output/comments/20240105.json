I didn't find it funny and thought the drama was over-the-top for a goofy setting. However, I wanted to retry it because it was beloved and thought it was a perspective thing, and I'm glad I did.\n\nIt can be strange getting into it at first, it flip-flops between eye-rolling puns and word soups and considerably depressing and oftentimes nihilistic storylines. At first, it feels disjointed, like a Mr. peanutbutter and tuna sandwich, but the show is mostly from the perspective of Bojack and Diane who are both deeply depressed people with nihilistic viewpoints of the world, and the world they live in feels goofy because it has animal people. \n\nAt first, it seems like a tonal misstep but once you delve into the characters it clicks. To these depressed-nihilistic characters, the absurdity of life and the abuse they have endured justifies them being terrible people who can't escape from the torment of life. And if you're a nihilist who has suffered in life it makes sense, to a point.\n\nFor the most part, serious moments in cartoons serve to add depth to what is generally a feel-good genre and to tie together the moral or situational themes, but Bojack totally flips it on its head and makes the goofy moments the tie-in for the nihilism. The same answerless existence that Bojack/Diane seem stuck in is made painfully apparent to the audience, they are in a goofy world, where they get to live among animals, live successful lives with lots of possibilities, but to them, the world is not unique so the cycles they go through make sense. It also feels fairly revolutionary considering how these types of stories are tonally bleak in comparison. Once you realize the setting for what it is and how it is tied into the characters' perspective the silliness of the puns and word soups become really funny.\n\nI've seen it mentioned a few times but it also goes over a lot of topics with a maturity that you rarely see. Things like asexuality, SA abuse, childhood trauma, spousal abuse, abortion, power dynamics, adoption, sycophancy, mob mentality\n\nTLDR: It's not a silly cartoon that gets dark, It's a story about depressed nihilistic characters who are juxtaposed with the absurd setting. To everyone in that universe that is the norm so it doesn't come off as absurd which plays into themes of only seeing nihilism through a depressive lens. It is amazingly written and tackles a multitude of serious topics well, without succumbing to Hollywoo gimmicks **9/10**",

The fight scenes were incredibly fun. It was a really fun watch & I hope Netflix renews this.\n\n**Percy Jackson**: (Disney+. weekly watch) This has been an entertaining family watch. The episodes are paced really well.  \n\n**The Resident**: (Hulu. background watch.) I stopped watching this because I didn\u2019t want to watch the Covid episodes while we were still in the pandemic but I recently picked this one back up (ironically while I had Covid). I\u2019m a sucker for most medical dramas (with the exception of Grey\u2019s Anatomy). This one fits the stereotypical bill. \n\n**For All Mankind**: (Apple. weekly watch) I\u2019m still really enjoying this show & thought this last episode was really good, so I\u2019m curious to see where all this goes. \n\n**Monarch Legacy of Monsters**: (Apple, weekly) It\u2019s mid. I\u2019m still interested enough to keep watching though. It\u2019s fine as a weekly but I wouldn\u2019t want to binge it. \n\n**Fool Me Once**: (Netflix. binged & finished) Eh. I was going to quit this one but then we ended up watching the whole thing. I didn\u2019t like the main actress & didn\u2019t buy her as the character she was supposed to be. The child served no purpose. The mystery/twist was ok. It could have been done much better but I\u2019ve also seen worse. Not enough Joanna Lumley. \n\n**Wild Crime**: (Hulu. binged seasons 2&3). If you like true crime & cult documentaries, then season 2 is for you. It was like a greatest hits album. It was wild (pun semi-intended). \n\n**Born in Synanon & Daughters of the Cult**: (Paramount & Hulu) cult documentaries. Interesting but not the most interesting ones I\u2019ve watched. Worth a watch if you like the genre. \n\n**Hell\u2019s Kitchen**: (Hulu. background weekly watch). I\u2019m not really invested in this. It just makes for a fine background watch. \n\n**The Amazing Race**: (Paramount. Season 35 binged & finished) I\u2019m so happy they stopped casting influencers & went back to regular people. I\u2019m also happy they brought back the ability to change flights & arrange travel - that always added such a fun element to the race. I had been disappointed in the last few seasons but really enjoyed this one.\n\n**The Days**: (Netflix) started this one when we last had Netflix & apparently didn\u2019t finish it before we rotated to another service so went back and finished this. It\u2019s a fictionalized retelling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. If you enjoyed Chernobyl then it\u2019s worth a watch. \n\n**Lupin**: (Netflix. Just started season 3). It\u2019s a fun watch if you don\u2019t take it too seriously. A French show about a thief who gets all of his heist ideas from the Arsene Lupin Gentleman Thief books.\n\n**What If**: (Disney +. Season 2) I liked this better than season 1 but still some episodes were hit or miss. I did enjoy the Die Hard parody & the final episode just because it was so out there. If you\u2019re not a Marvel/MCU fan then you probably would not enjoy the show too much.",

Pretty much always love top HBO shows although its a slow burn im here for it.

I wasn't actually expecting much from this show, but what got me excited was seeing my man Matty in the trailer.\n\nI feel like this show leans more towards Maya\u2019s character exploration rather than the whole crime-action kind. Of course, there are some action scenes that are very good, by the way. But I wasn't very satisfied with this show. The first two episodes are good, and then it felt boring to watch. The pacing felt really slow after the initial episodes despite the fact that the series has only a few episodes.>!I thought this would be like an all-action and crime kind of series, giving a neat story of Maya\u2019s past, which the story did. However, how come they left out the fact of why Kingpin wanted Maya\u2019s father dead? Instead, this show brought in all that ancestral family stuff, like they did with Ms. Marvel (which I liked, by the way), and it didn't even feel interesting to watch.!<The finale is bland, and the soundscore, especially in the finale, felt irritating. I was like, \u2018come on, let\u2019s get on with the climax.\u2019\n\nOverall, the series is okay-ish for me. It\u2019s not as bad as Secret Invasion; maybe it settles near Ms. Marvel. However, it has fantastic action and fight scenes except for the finale scene. Alaqua Cox is just brilliant in her role. But the spotlight is a turnoff (at least for me, except the ones involving Fisk). And the pacing could have been better.",

In some ways, it seemed like they put more effort into promoting Bruce than Cybill. (Considering Cybill Shepherd was more popular than Bruce then, it's understandable, but it felt so desperate\ud83d\ude02) But he pulled it off somehow and it didn't feel cringey at all. I had fun watching it.\n\nAnyway it was a really fun and romantic show. Watching this made me realize how much I missed the romantic comedy genre. As a detective drama, it was wonky, but since it wasn't a fully detective drama, the mystery elements were used well to spice up the romance between main characters. It worked perfectly as a background. The chemistry between the two actors was great. I immediately understood why it was so successful when it was aired. I've lost interest in TV shows lately and haven't been watching them for a long time, but this show successfully hooked me. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of it.",

Netflix is also getting her latest, *Everything Will Come True,* which looks like another fantasy/romance series with a genie and a heroine without emotions. :)\n\n[*Little Woman*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MojG-yDmPTM) has nearly nothing of Louisa May Alcott in it other than it's about a family of poor sisters, but one of them lands into a pile of embezzled cash. It's a crime thriller.  This one was written by Jung Seo-Kyoung, who also wrote [*Mother*](https://www.viki.com/tv/35736c-mother)*. Mother* was a 2018 Kdrama remake of a 2010 JDrama about an ornithologist, filling in as a grade school teacher, who realizes one of her students is being abused and kidnaps her to save her life. \n\nSlice-of-life-workplace dramedy, I also really liked [*Today's Webtoon*](https://www.hulu.com/series/1b9f3b29-1176-4e70-bb54-d6b61e09a7b8)*.* It's based on a Jdrama that's based on a manga. While the Japanese version centered on a weekly manga magazine staff, the Kdrama was centered on the editors of a webtoon site.",

I guess there's a  relatability and a warmth to his performances.\n\n**Fargo season 5, episode 9**. >!For whatever reason I thought I was watching the last episode of the season (I suppose you can consider it the finale pt. 1). It got me on the edge of my seat but, come on Doty, hide in the pit? Leaving the rifle behind? It felt like a too convenient way for the writers to intersect her story with that of the nihilist, a bit contrived. Anyway, I think they are going to land it beautifully and this will become the third best season of Fargo. The narrative in this season has been much more straight-forward than that of the others, which were a bit more convoluted, a bit more full of twists and turns. Kudos to Hamm, I wasn't exactly buying his character on the first half of the season, but it's going to become one of the staples of his career alongside Draper, imo. I guess they are going full Waco next week.!<",

Season 4 is definitely prime Mentalist, but it's also one of the few shows of the genre that continued to get better as it went on (compared to a show like The Blacklist that just gave up at trying to be anything remotely good at some point.) The last season was my favorite season, like by far - and I loved it from the pilot episode.. And yes, there are filler episodes, but that was late 2000s/early 2010s television for you - even complete plot-driven shows like LOST had fillers, and the fillers were almost all great usually.\n\nPatrick Jane is also in my top five main characters of all time, so that certainly helps a lot, specifically with filler eps. It shocks me that Simon Baker didn't get a starring role on another show after The Mentalist was over, though if I recall he may have just moved back to Australia and only does Australian entertainment now.",

The first few seasons were nice, then the quality dropped dramatically.\n\n**Verano Azul**, 1980's coming of age show that's very much engrained in the collective psyche of Spain.\n\n**Historias para no dormir**, this one has had several installments through the years, much like The Twilight Zone, which is a clear referent in its conception. There are some really good episodes, others not so much.\n\n**Qu\u00e9 fue de Jorge Sanz**, sitcom. This one is kind of meta, Jorge Sanz is an actor, kind of a household name in Spain. So he plays a version of himself and they have fun with that. Quite inspired on Curb I guess. But it's not Curb, it's not pure comedy.\n\n**El hombre la Tierra**, docuseries 1970's-early 80's. The natural world, beautifully shot. Ignited the passion of many generations for environmentalism.\n\n**Turno de Oficio**, 1980's, legal series. Dramedy.\n\n**7 vidas**. They made a ton of seasons with this one, recasting a lot. I mention this show because with this one Spanish tv creators were beginning to find their footing in creating something that wasn't a pure a copycat of US products (or should I say, taking those templates and putting their own stamp on them- in this case it would be \"Friends\").

And Alaqua Cox is as amazing as she was in *Hawkeye.* I also found it incredibly cool that Devery Jacobs was signing as fluently as she was given that she also had to learn a huge amount of Mohawk for Kahhori in *What If...?*  I also found it interesting that >!while Echo is Choctaw and Kahhori is Mohawk, all Native characters in the MCU now get their glowing superpowers from the same source: a glowing underground magic lake. !<\n\nBut what may affect how you view this one is the fact that most of the  scenes are primarily in ASL. As with any foreign-language show :), you *cannot* second screen this one.\n\nLastly, the episode lengths are mostly in the 35-45 minute range. It may be a faster binge than you're expecting at 5 episodes. The total clocks in at 209 minutes, or about 3.5 hours.

Really great cast filled with some cutthroat players on both sides. Didn\u2019t really care for the multiple recruitments, but it was still a fun ride from start to finish. I also liked the challenges better than the ones in the US and UK seasons (which were more or less identical).\n\nCurrently watching:\n\n* The Traitors (UK, S2) \u2014 Only watched half of episode one, so not a lot to say.\n\nPlanning to watch:\n\n* Slow Horses (S2) \u2014 Will probably start the first episode after posting this comment.\n* The Traitors (US, S2) \u2014 The season premieres tomorrow (1/12) and I couldn\u2019t be more excited since there are some Big Brother and Survivor legends on the cast!",

When I saw that it was a 2022 release I was excited that there may be a season coming soon.  It's a fairly quick paced and manages to not be convoluted despite involving multiple timelines.  Very cool concept without feeling like it's trying too hard to be \"deep\" or \"thought-provoking\".\n\n**Murder at the End of the World:** Loved this as well, it felt like the best of a detective who-dun-it combined with a *very* near future sci-fi. Highly recommend.\n\n**Undone:**  I'm currently two episodes in and loving it so far. Visually stunning and I'm already immersed in the underlying concept.  Can't wait to binge this one.  The 23 minute episodes makes it feel like it's moving both fast and slow at the same time.  I like the pacing.\n\nSome other shows I really enjoy: **Foundation, Wheel of Time, The White Lotus, Severance, Pantheon**.

I wonder if Neruomancer will end up being adapted by apple TV as there was some discussion about that.\n\nReminds me that I need to watch season 2 of Pantheon. Glad it ended up happening as I remember after S1 with AMC+ mistreating the show (airing things out of order) it took Amazon picking up the distribution rights for S2 for people to get it.\n\n\n\nSome recommendations of things not canceled or struggling to reach another season (I'm looking at you The Orville)\n\n\n* Carol and the End of the World: Directionless MC is unable to fit in while the whole world seems to have accepted that the world will end with the collision of another planet against the Earth. A bit of an awkward start but it gets its legs after a few episodes and I like a good amount of the writing but do struggle with some of the choices in nudity (but I looked past it). \n\n* 12 Monkeys (TV show): Just a very good time travel series that gets more well written after every season.\n\n* Gary and his Demons: Middle aged man working for a company hunting demons as the \"chosen one\". Hates his job and wants to pass it off to someone else. I overall enjoyed the humor.\n\n* Outer Range: MC owns a ranch with his family (the Abbott family) that is facing property disputes with a competing ranch. When a giant hole opens up in the middle of his property which seems to be the starting point in a catastrophe. Explaining things is unfortunately a spoiler but it was a highlight in Sci-Fi storytelling. Hopeful about the second season releasing this year I think (filming wrapped up recently).\n\n* Years and Years: If anything you take away from this show is the soundtrack than it was worth the watch. Written by Russell T Davies (A Dr. Who writer) is a story written in 2018 (released in 2019) showing the life of the Lyon family in 6 episodes following their lives until 2034. Its a series tackling populist leaders, LGBTQ+ issues, class dynamics within the perspective of the family. It can be a bit preachy and forceful with its political messaging and IIRC the first half of the series was more enjoyable than the second. But I do reflect on watching the series in its entirety as a positive experience.",

I enjoyed his surprise performance.\n\n*Letterkenny* - Finally caught up after missing the previous season and went through the finale. It felt like the right time to end it, and the final season was just really a homage to the  best bits of the series.

The first two seasons in particular are uneven, with a few episodes not worth watching.

Like, you can appreciate how well a show is done, but because you've seen so many things already, you have a \"been there, done that\" feeling you can't shake off?\n\nI finally started **Haunting of Hill House**. Its brilliant. The character drama is great, the horror is well done too(except for the occasional clich\u00e9 open mouth scream scene) and after watching 3 episodes I'm somewhat in love with it. But I'm also thinking since the very first episode that I know exactly where its going. Simply because I've seen too many things already so I notice what it sets itself up to be and where the threads are gonna go. \n\nNot a fault of the show, but what can you do about it? Nothing I suppose. One standout thing I need to mention tho, is how amazingly the young actors have been chosen. Not only are they all good, but they really do look like younger versions of the adults. Great casting!\n\nAlso started **Slow Horses** after universal praise. But after watching the first episode I knew its not for me. I found the set up dull and too blatant tbh. Its a problem I have with a lot of british Drama shows: they're always so incredibly blatant. Like everything that could be interesting is immediately thrown in your face. And the shows always feel the need to remind you about the dynamics constantly.",

And they\u2019ve made at least two films about it too. But I totally get what you mean. I felt like that with Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. I knew where some of the episodes of the plot were going to go without seeing them. I will say, in Hill House there\u2019s a lot of fun, scary stuff. There are a lot of hidden ghosts in scenes that you don\u2019t necessarily notice on first watch. There are some twists and wild things that happen in the back half of the show. I rewatch it every October so it\u2019s still good even if you know what\u2019s coming.",
