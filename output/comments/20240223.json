It's so goddamn good. The writing is insane, thanks to writers Tony Gilroy, Dan Gilroy, and Beau Willimon. They actually respect the audience's intelligence. There isn't a light saber to be seen, and the whole story is better for it. And *the themes!* Fascism, imperialism, oppression, rebellion, etc. And the structure of the entire season is perfection, with about 4 arcs of 3 episodes each. I honestly feel too dumb to say anything intelligent about it, that's how good the writing is (which comes as no surprise if you've ever seen Tony Gilroy's ***Michael Clayton***).\n\nFor anyone who's thinking of watching/rewatching ***Andor***, I *highly* recommend the episode discussions done by a podcast called ***A More Civilized Age*** (I think they only cover SW stuff. It's hosted by a group of folks from the video games industry, I believe). Excellent listening if you want to delve more into not just the little details you might've missed, but mature, nuanced, academic-level discussions of the themes throughout. They're also just really funny MFers.",

The use of sound in this show is really good--it is used to emphasize mundane tasks to show the repeated drudgery, and also just how empty and lonely the offices are.  It's almost like a lot of ASMR (and even includes one character who seems to do that in the \"wellness\" sessions.)\n\nIt's very slow though, and it's the kind of show where you really need to plunk yourself in front of it with minimal distractions to really get into the atmosphere of the things going on.

There's also Past Lives, which won many awards even though it's Korean - the quiet moments felt very relatable. \n\nI'm still looking for more. As a Japanese-Brazilian, these shows let me explore a past that isn't exactly mine, but that *feels* like a part of my own confused identity.

I've seen a couple other series set in (at least partially) Japan, but I wouldn't say I can think of any that touch upon Japanese *history*, per se. \n\nOthers that I was considering recommending are ***Giri/Haji***, which splits its time between modern London and Tokyo (but mostly London), and ***Monarch: Legacy of Monsters***, which is decent and partially set in Japan (although the cast is globetrotting elsewhere, too).\n\nIf you're open to anime, I would assume there are tons of anime series that dig into Japanese history, but it might take some searching to find more grounded, less-fantastical ones. Might be worth asking in the top-pinned post on /r/anime to see if they can provide some recommendations.",

But a bit of searching threw up this (*[Pillars of The Earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth_(miniseries))*) as a suggestion.\n\nIt's set during England's \"[Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy)\" in the 12^(th) Century and features an absolutely badass cast - Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Matthew Macfadyen, Eddie Redmayne, Hayley Atwell, Donald Sutherland, and Sarah Parish. Made in 2010.\n\nHaving watched the first two episodes, I don't understand why I've never heard of this before. It's excellent, and I'll probably binge all eight episodes in a row now. With some other historical fiction series I ended up finding them a bit shallow and repetitive eventually, with an overreliance on sex'n'violence. *Pillars* is based upon a novel, that is itself set amongst real historical events, and as such it's definitely driven by the plot - instead of the plot just being an excuse for action scenes and the occasional boobie. I've no objection to either... but I'd just rather there was a bit more to it than that.\n\nSo anyway, I recommend. It's really good so far, particularly the performances of McShane, MacFayden, Redmayne, and Atwell. Great plot too, centred around an unusual and interesting topic. I'm going to have to look for something similar after I've finished this, as I refuse to watch any more of *Shogun* until the last episode's come out - so I can binge the crap out of episodes 3 to 10 uninterrupted.",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching this, it doesn\u2019t really have any evidence to back it up and goes round in circles. \n\nAlso finished: **Can I Tell You A Secret?** a 2 part true crime doc on Netflix about a case of online harassment/stalking.

These may not seem connected to what you have watched but I am basing this on the fact that I liked all those shows and also liked:\n\n1980s: It is a show that got a remake recently. There are spaceships and conflict and incredible destruction. No I am not talking about Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Instead I will point you towards a much, much sillier show. **Urusei Yatsura** is a rom com with some great creators contributing to it. You don't need to watch all of it but maybe watch some and then look around for a \"best episodes and movies\" list. Talent includes Oshi Mamoru before he made Ghost in the Shell and Rumiko Takahashi before Ranma or Inu Yasha. \n\n1990s: The original version of **Kenshin**. A bit dated but very good. Another show with a remake that I haven't checked out. I could recommend the original for the voice acting and music alone. The story and action of course are the real draw. \n\n2000s recommendation: **Bokurano**. Underappreciated show that is an incredible downer, but also filled with meaning and inspiration. Warning. It may depress you then inspire you to move forward despite the futility of existence. \n\n2010s is the age of Isekai so I will pick one of the best that doesn't get seen enough. **Grimgar** deserves more love. Honestly it could have existed without being an Isekai. Coming of age story vibes and starts kind of embarrassingly horny but it delivers the feels. It asks the question, what is it really like to be a party in a fantasy world. Killing monsters doesn't just mean you become more powerful, it means you take a life. Of all these shows I am recommending this is the one I would tell you to go find and watch first and to stick with through to the end. There is only one season but yeah, do it even if it doesn't sound like your jam off that bat. Fuck I think I will go watch it again now.\n\n2020s will continue to deliver the gut punches with **To Your Eternity**. It justifies itself and is not just emotionally manipulative. Great opening theme too.",

The characters are so good, and it's one of those shows that just feels like it knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do, and keeps on nailing it. Looking forward to season 2.\n\nI also watched season 1 of **The Traitors (US version)** and I'm a few episodes into season 1 of the UK version. The US version was good. I enjoyed it, but honestly (without spoiling anything) it wasn't as satisfying as I'd hoped overall. I think it's because of how emotionally involved everyone was by the end, so it just felt kind of sad.\n\nI'm actually liking the UK version a lot better so far. I didn't really like the reality star element of the US version, and having it all be regular people gives it a different vibe (even though much of the show is *extremely similar* to the US version, even down to the location and many of the competitions they play). Overall it just feels a bit more authentic, whereas in the US version I could feel the hand of the producers/editors a lot of the time in what they chose to show and what people were saying.",

Second season not hitting quite the same as the first but I haven't finished it so that could change.\n\nHouse of Ninjas is a fun watch - similar to Brother Sun I think Netflix did a good job with this genre of \"serious and violent but also goofy\"",

Zuko is far less annoying early on than he was in the original.\n\nHaving Ozai with more screentime actually helps to flesh out Zuko and Azula better. I think leaving Ozai till the end of the show made his character very shallow.\n\nCons:\n\nNot a surprise but most of the younger actors don't hold up well. The one that pains me the most so far is Azula whose actress does not do Azula justice.\n\nI think the biggest detriment to the show is the fighting scenes. As a very action heavy show, the fighting scenes still look very cheesy. Maybe it just suffers in the same way doing a live action of Naruto would in that it just looks too comical in live action.",

HBO Max canceled it after bringing it back literally for no response prob cause of the Hollywood strike last year.

I knew within minutes who the stalker was. I also *kind of* get why people were saying the man guy was shady--it's very glossed over that he broke up with or clearly ended it with Girl A before hooking up with Girl B. **that does NOT excuse what happened** but it seems like he's leaning on \"well I told her I wanted casual!\" a bit too much. \n\n**Rap Sh_t** Season 2, finished it up. Very bummed to see this cancelled/not picked up. This was a very funny show that was partly filling the Insecure Show-Hole and I will miss it. If anyone has suggestions I'm all ears! I've already seen Run the World, Harlem, Girlfriends, Sweet Life, Atlanta, I'm a Virgo Swarm, 20-something (on BET)...I'm considering the reality show \"Impact\" (NYC and Atlanta) but again...any suggestions, hit me with them!\n\n**Ex-Pats** I dunno, oof. The latest episode (the one where they focus on the secondary or side characters) was great, but the one before that dragged and I wound up FF through a few parts. I find both Mercy and David really tough to watch and sympathize with and find them drawn rather shallow-ly although very, very familiar \"types\" especially David, from my time in SEAsia as an expat. \n\nI'm not sure if this counts, but the 50 part **Who the F did I marry**\" extravaganza on TikTok was a fun ride. I felt she elaborated a bit too much at times, but there's so much to unpack and I'm enjoying the commentary. I'd be interested to see if her culture/background and his played a role in the events--there were some hints that it may have (to me). For example, the family and the expectation of being close and having a big, fun, happy family that he faked. Or the attitudes around money and class--were there some cultural expectations and attitudes that affected the outcomes and the lies he told? To me there is hints of that, but I'd love for a sociologist or anthropologist to deep-dive that!",

            "body": "Avatar. Is it better than the worst expectations? Yes. Is it better than the worst expectations from looking critically at the trailer? Yes. Is it as good as the cartoon? No. Is it a carbon copy of the cartoon? No. Do they change things that violate the spirit or story beats of the cartoon, do they generally understand the characters? Generally yes. Are there obvious holes? Yes. Is it's existence justified? Yes\n\nIn some ways it's a similar adaptation to One Piece, not quite as good, but they combine some things and cut some things you'd expect based of time, the characters for the most part are intact or have alterations that you'd expect from something aiming to be a bit more mature without going grim dark. \n\nThe worst parts are the direction and editing. Some super clunky editing here and there. People claim about gran gran giving clunky dialogue which is word for word the iconic wording from the cartoon intro. I see this as primarily a failure of direction, and then the actress, and of course you're pretty limited in options when you're looking for a 50+ year old native american/innuit actress. This pops up a lot where ultimately the good actors get to shine in their roles and the not so good ones all seem like they're reading off of a teleprompter. Unfortunately in the latter category is Gordon Cormier as Aang. You can see why they cast him, he has the right look and demeanor, but he reminds me so much of the Emerald Island Players Aang. \n\nDallas Liu as Zuko is the main cast stand out, and his relationship with Uncle Iroh and struggle with his identity the most compelling storyline in season one. Other storylines are Aang's struggle with responsibility and violence, which is carried heavier here than it was in the cartoon. The ability to show the consequences of war more explicitly and Aang realizing that he's unfit for the responsibility hit harder and more true than the TV series. This is possibly a reason that there was a decision to not have Aang learn water bending.\n\nThings that could be improvements/that justify the existence\n\n1. Aang seems to be having more interaction with his past lives. I'm wondering if they'll extend this even beyond the immediate 4 previous Avatars we've seen. \n\n2. Aang is even more tied to the Avatar state here. It really feels like he will fail without it, and they offer a bit of a better explanation than the series for his need to master the elements as apparently he can't master the Avatar state until he master's the elements. They also indicated more serious repercussions for merging with spirits like the ocean spirit\n\n3. Zhao is the one character I think we can say as a consensus is improved in the series. He seems more formidable as an adversary here than just a brute in power. He's even a little sympathetic. \n\n4. Zuko's character arc is being done a service so far. It's even benefitting from knowing the full arc that they probably didn't have during season one. The actor really sells his rage when he bends, which we know ultimately changes. \n\n5. Iroh isn't done quite as well here. The voice is of course impossible for anyone, but he's a little flatter of a character here, a little more grounded than wise sage. I liked the funeral scene, but I don't like how that plays with the timeline as it hints at a transformation for Iroh himself that at best you can now say would happen in a couple of years instead of a decade plus or whatever it was. \n\n6. The spirit world is handled well. I hope they can explore it in an interesting way that won't damage it like Korra did. I liked Yue as the fox. \n\n7. The ability to go more pg-13 with the burnings and the killings. \n\n8. Fire Lord Ozai is also an improvement on the cartoon. \n\n9. Azula I would say doesn't really need to be here this season, but I do think her being here this season builds a stronger throughline for the show in general. \n\n10. Some of the sets are really great. The fire palace is great. I think they maybe could have taken a little more artistic license here and there? But the settings in the show were always a strong point too so whatever. \n\nThings that aren't so good\n\n1. Gran Gran, Aang, other characters, often the acting/delivery is bad\n\n2. I think the direction sometimes must just suck\n\n3. The editting is way off sometimes\n\n4. The CGI is sometimes bad or way too obvious - I don't knock this too much because I prefer a good executed fake looking idea over just not doing it at all\n\n5. Some inclusions of some material from the show is clunky, not fleshed out, or half-baked. The best example that I'm sure will be cited for ever is Bumi. I don't really hate the idea of Bumi as more jaded but the whole thing felt like it was a fight between changing it and not changing it. Bumi's entire court is synchophants that  laugh at everything he says? Let's include the growing stones from teh show as a trial! I guess? But it's really just to fuck with Aang? It was like, Aang is going to be with him this whole episode so we have to kill some time to get to the part that we actually want which is Bumi trying to force Aang to kill him to make a point. I don't even think that's a bad idea really, but we're just snapping back and forth. I feel like we're almost reliant on knowing the original, what they change, and appreciating it for that instead of the whole sequence standing on its own. Another example: here's library owl! What's he doing here? Chillin\n\n6. Yue looked terrible. Also the Yue/Sokka/Yue sacrifice just didn't quite work. I'm not sure why. Ironically the Suki/Sokka relationship is another thing that could go into the improvments category. \n\n7. Costumes were too copied from the show and came off as fake and cartoony. I haven't seen the 2010 Avatar movie, but from the stills that is one thing that it has over this adaptation. \n\n8. Bending really goes in both categories. I think it looks good overall but the powerscaling feels really inconsistent. There's a scene where Iroh is captured and his captor puts a huge boulder over his head effortlessly, but then in the opening scene there's a struggle to leviate probably 10% of that weight? Water bending also looks like people getting splashed.",

My main complaint would be that the main storyline could literally fit on the back of a stamp, only moving forward thanks to obvious plot devices with the big reveal consisting of two 5 min dialogues/infos dump in the finale. Now, I don't mind a slow moving story with a lot of backstory and human drama but here I failed to care about any of these storylines that only felt like poorly written filler and really struggled to care about any of the characters. The shortcomings of the main storylines also lead to rampant plot holes arising from the attempts of keeping the viewer interested. \nOn the plus side, the cinematography is really nice and the iceland landscapes are obviously gorgeous. The actors did a pretty good job overall, especially given the material they were given to work with, especially Jodie Foster that delivers a really strong performance.",

I felt like the acting performances got more compelling as the story progressed and the twists and turns kept me hooked. \n\n**Hazbin Hotel** - I jumped on this one after a fellow Redditor sold this as \u201cAdult Tangled but in Hell\u201d or something similar. That just really caught my interest for some reason and now that I\u2019ve watched the show I can sort of see it. Crazy hooks to get me watching aside I have to say I enjoyed this one a lot more than I expected. I\u2019d rate it up there with Harley Quinn in terms of modern comedy animations. The premise was really fun with the Princess of Hell seeking to redeem a bunch of souls so they could finally make it to Heaven. The story and characters were a ton of fun, I loved the animation style, and I even loved *gasps* the musical numbers! This gets a massive thumbs up from me. I\u2019ll have to try more Amazon animated shows because they absolutely nailed it with Hazbin Hotel and Invincible. \n\n**True Detective: Night Country** - This might not be Reddit\u2019s favourite show and I can see why it might have turned some folks off but I did personally quite enjoy it. I\u2019ve actually enjoyed all 4 seasons of True Detective to varying degrees so was happy to see them renew it for a 5th season. Nothing touches the first season of TD but I think I enjoyed this more than the third season where I had some pacing issues. Though I was weekly with season 3 vs binge watch for season 4 so that might have helped with my enjoyment of this latest season. Season four was not perfect but I found it a pretty solid watch. I could have done with less of the supernatural nonsense but I was still mostly satisfied with the show despite the flaws. It had that HBO high quality production feel and the acting from both Foster and Reis was good. \n\n**Criminal Record** - I was a little unsure of this Brit crime drama in the early stages but felt like it got better and better by the episode as the characters got fleshed out and the plot thickened. Capaldi and Jumbo were great in their roles. This ended in a fairly satisfying way to work as a limited series but they also left the door open for more. I\u2019d watch more for sure but hope they bring back both Jumbo and Capaldi for more. \n\n**The Vince Staples Show** - Feels a bit of a cheat to call this a TV series since it was basically a 90-100 minute movie but I guess that is what it is. Not a memorable show but definitely very watchable. \n\n**Slow Horses s3** - This third season was as great as ever. Might even be my favourite season so far. Great mix of drama and comedy and the show always looks very slick for a Brit show. In a weak upcoming Emmy season for ongoing dramas I hope Slow Horses finally earns some deserved recognition! \n\nNext up I\u2019m probably going with **Expats** and possibly **Reacher s2** or **Kin**.",

I watched the cartoon for the first time as a university student, and have watched the series 4-5 times in total. It's one of my all time favorite shows. I *enjoyed* the live action, and in some ways I think it adds value to the series, but I don't think it was good either.\n\nI think the cartoon is nearly perfect so I ask myself, what could a live action adaptation add? Well it should obviously introduce a broader audience to ATLA (it did). It should show us how cool bending might look with real people (arguably it did). And I think a good adaptation captures the spirit of the source material, while making concessions so that it works for a television show or movie. This is where I think it failed.\n\nIt's impossible for me to not have a biased view, but I don't think the Netflix show stands alone on its own merits. There was definitely a lot of attention to detail and you could see that it was trying to honor its source material, but I think this effort was misplaced and that the focus on the details was only on a superficial level. There was a lot of blatant fanservice, which I'd say was to its advantage most of the time, but I felt that in trying to not leave anything out from season one, it felt too rushed and didn't allow for enough character growth/development. Which doesn't even make sense, because both first seasons have almost the same total run time.\n\nAs is the problem with a lot of adaptations, it really fails to capture the heart and soul of the original and does not do the characters justice. It's like the showrunner meticulously watched each episode, but never took the time to reflect on what any of it actually meant. They saw it, but they didn't understand it. I think all of the things that the live action show does well are **not** the reasons that people like the cartoon. It surprised me how many small things they chose to include, while simultaneously leaving out (or getting wrong) incredibly fundamental parts of the story related to the plot or specific characters. I worry that for people who are experiencing ATLA for the first time through the Netflix show, this is going to be completely forgettable and it's not interesting enough on its own to get them to watch the cartoon.",

The illusion of time in shows has really been lost with 8 episode seasons for any show. But it's so crucial in making growing relationships between characters believable. In the LA Katara basically became a master water bender in what felt like 1 week.",

I was however not always sold on the plot and it ultimately left me a bit frustrated and expecting more. The first 3 episodes were great but then the story stalled and the goofy chase and escape repetitive scenario got old pretty quick. >!The plot armor of the protagonist was definitely too heavy for my taste!<.

Still had a solid ending though, 7.5/10\n\n**Constellation** - sci-fi mystery with extremely well done atmospheric horror. Love seeing Jonathon Banks. Have high hopes for this, but it's the type of mystery where the ending can make it break it\n\n**House of Ninjas** - fun enough for what it is. Seems like a live action anime without the cringe dialogue that comes with anime. Good action scenes but not quite enough of them, it's more like a family drama for about half of the series. 6.8/10\n\nLast but definitely not least, **Masters of the Air** - absolutely phenomenal mini series based on the book of the same name. About the 100th bomber group in WW2. Harrowing, tense, and extremely true to the book. It's up there with Chernobyl for one of the best mini series of all time. 9/10\n\nEdit: upcoming shows for me to watch, The Vince Staples Show, Shogun, Tokyo Vice, true detective, Halo, and of course finishing constellation and masters of the air. Possibly the second best hospital in the galaxy, will wait to see how reviews pan out over the next day or two",

Possibly because almost all of the production and writing team were men? Not saying that that is for sure what happened, I just know that there is a lot of behind-the-scenes strangeness that we've only heard snippets of that ended with Fleabag leaving the producing/writing team. It kinda makes sense that writing for the female lead isn't quite as tight, given that.\n\nThere were definitely *more than a few moments* where Jane felt really 2d and flat to me. I don't blame Maya Erskine though, I blame the writing. Super spoiler heavy example: >!how could Jane *possibly* think that John killed Max. It literally made ZERO SENSE that she would believe that. Literally zero sense. And it's the impetus for the entire final episode. That was just high absurdity to me.!< And there were other weirdnesses with the writing for Jane to me too.\n\nOverall, I loved it. And I love Donald Glover and will follow him anywhere.

It's an Australian dramedy about a hitman (more or less), but it maintains (and increases!) its quality across its three seasons.\n\n>It manages to be both a comedy and drama/crime/thriller. You'll be laughing every single episode, and crying during others. The one-two punch of comedy-then-heartbreak knocks you off your feet. Some moments are so incredibly harrowing, leaving you in silence, thinking, \"well... shit that got dark.\"\n\n>It's legitimately one of the best crime dramas (crime dramedies?) ever, right up there with Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. The character of Ray Shoesmith (played masterfully by writer/actor Scott Ryan) is an all-time great character. I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\n>A perhaps pithy way to describe Mr Inbetween might be \"Barry for people who liked being crushed by Fleabag.\"\n\nIt's just all around stellar. And after that, I can't help but recommend ***Patriot***. Ignore the bland name and go in blind. It's an absurd spy dramedy that feels like Wes Anderson by way of the Coen brothers.

Everything about it just felt not quite up to standard of some of the more modern shows I've watched recently. 5/10 overall, there were some good episodes but overall show felt flat.\n\n\n**Lost** - Now this holds up to the test of time. I'm currently finishing 5th season soon. Some seasons have felt better, some not so but overall it is an absolutely amazing watch. The longer 20+ episode seasons can feel very drawn out these days but the show managed to keep attention so that it didn't at any point feel like there was just filler content. Depending how strong the end is I think I'll give it 8 or 9 out of 10.\n\n\nNew shows I'm now watching weekly:\n\n**Constellation** - Intriguing so far. Doesn't really feel to me like it is going to be an absolute top show but still would recommend based on the early episodes to people who love mysteries with little side of horror.\n\n**Shogun** - Absolutely amazing first 2 episodes. Most excited I've been since Succession for new episodes.The show feels complex, intriguing, epic scale, some fascinating characters  - everything I love about a show. If the show can keep building on the first episodes this has the potential to be one of the best shows of the year. The only complaint I may have is that some characters feel a bit one dimensional, I hope it doesn't turn out to be that there's a clear good guy and bad guy. I feel to survive in that environment everyone would have to in the moral gray zone.",

As someone else who read the book and liked it, the scenes I\u2019m talking about that got chopped are ones that made me roll my eyes at the time.\n\nThe visuals and costuming are all really well done, the acting has really great, and the dialogue, which has probably been about 60% in Japanese so far, is well written (a lot of it mirrors the book pretty closely, to my memory). \n\nI was really sold on the world of 1600 Japan, it was very well depicted. Perhaps the best accolade I give the depiction of Japan is this: my wife is Japanese and I watched the first episode of Shogun alone because I thought I\u2019d be embarrassed to watch it next to her, but I need not have worried.\n\nAs an American I\u2019m not sure exactly how you overly \u201cAmericanize\u201d an Australian book about an Englishman in Japan, but you should set your worries aside and watch this one.

It has all the base elements, aesthetic cinematography, lighting, memorable characters, and carefully-crafted kino scenes that slowly comes together like loose threads in a loom spinning a gorgeous, evocative tapestry.  The opening theme is concise and unskippable, and the rest of the soundtrack has some bangers.  Every character, from the charming and compelling leads that are Gereon and Charlotte to the plodding fillers for which I couldn't care less like Greta and Helga, were a joy to watch.  For some reason I've enjoyed this way more than Dark.  Don't be like Dark; don't hire faceblind casting directors and ask them to ensure that every character looks like they came from the same inbred family.  At least everyone in Babylon Berlin stands out and are memorable across episodes.  I didn't need a wiki and a notepad to follow along with this.\n\nI've binged the first two seasons right when they first came out and the third season in 2020, so while it had been fun revisiting such impeccable art, it's also sad to see that Netflix are removing this and will not be airing the fourth season, due to in order to free up more server space for more copies of Cuties to be streamed on-demand to their creepy demographic.  That's fine, I can't wait to cancel and be done with this nasty disgusting grooming psy-op of a steaming dog turd of a streaming service.  And from now on, if I encounter anyone in real life that has a Netflix subscription on their home devices, they're going to learn what happens to people who pays money to have legal access to stream and pause a movie about young teenage girls doing provocative dance moves at certain scenes.",
