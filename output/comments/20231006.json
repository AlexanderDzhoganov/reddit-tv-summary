The humor seems to be hitting me a lot more often now that its cast and themes are established, and I keep on being shocked by how invested I am in its central romance. Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi\u2019s performances are phenomenal, probably the best of either of their careers.\n\nAlso, episode 3!!!  >!The \u201ckraken\u201d being brought back to life by a \u201cmerman\u2019s\u201d love! Kate Bush! Wild. Insane. Camp. Both hilariously cheesy and satisfyingly romantic.!< This show, man. \n\nStill, despite the gushing, I will admit that I am personally a bit worried about episodes beyond this chunk struggling to maintain momentum. S1 started as an ensemble workplace comedy, but then it gradually escalated its drama to deliver a finale that really surprised me and hit me hard. My fear is that s2\u2019s dramatic peak might have already occurred, and the rest of the season could feel meandering or fluffy. I was already worried about s2 having only 8 episodes when I ended s1 feeling the plot it covered could have used even more episodes than 10, and the idea that s2 might be frontloading its angst or its character development makes me fear that the best has already happened, and the rest might just be typical comedy show hijinks until the last episode pulls out a hook for a third season. Still, this show keeps delivering and I keep eating it up. So far, s2 looks to be an improvement from s1 rather than a regression, so I have faith.",

He considered changing or ditching the show altogether. And then Rami came in. He brings such a raw vulnerability to the part. You can\u2019t help but root for him. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you what a lot of fans say- Mr. Robot is a show that changes you.

The final episode does have quite a few action scenes but overall it wasn't enough. Episode 2 was downright boring. \n\n**Gen V**- Having now watched 4 episodes, I'm just loving this show. The characters are interesting, there are some crazy stuff including in episode 4 and the story is fascinating too. \n\n**Loki season 2**- Fantastic season premiere, really enjoyed it. Quite a few mysteries too.",

By the end, I felt like I'd gone too far not to finish.  However, it was one of those shows that got cancelled between seasons, so the finale is not just unsatisfying but absolutely awful!

            "body": "Finished **Wheel of Time** yesterday.  As a longtime fan of the books, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Seeing the parts from the books was great (and sometimes heartbreaking, RIP >!Hopper!<) and it was interesting to see how the show made different choices from the books.  It's been a long time since I've gotten to theorize over one of Min's viewings, and seeing how it played out in the show was pretty cool.  I know some of the moments may seem like deus ex machina to viewers, but.... they were kinda that way in the books too.  I thought some of the new characters added this season were great: Elayne was very sweet, kind, and supportive, she's almost like a female Sam Gamgee to Egwene, Lanfear was... whoof. \n\nFinished **Ahsoka** as well.  Like /u/abbzug said, it felt like half a pound of plot in a ten pound bag (with WoT being the reverse) and that felt like a very apt metaphor. I've seen Rebels and Clone Wars (and read Zahn's Thrawn books back when I was a kid), but I struggled to get enthused about much of anything in Ahsoka beyond the big midseason cameo. There's hardly anything happening, there was no fleshing out of the antagonists beyond vague references and whatever you remembered from previous shows, and the \"cool\" moments felt pretty hollow.  This is maybe a better question for /r/StarWars , but it makes me wonder like... what exactly *is* Star Wars, or \"true\" Star Wars, especially these days?  At best it seems like archetypal characters doing cool stuff with weapons and ships with a retrofuturistic scifi vibe - but real light on plot, actual characterization, or anything really substantial - like the showrunners are playing around with $150 million action figures.  And I'm not judging, I kinda think that's how most people interact with Star Wars, at least for those who started loving it as kids.  But it's not really meeting basic expectations we have for pretty much any other story in TV, film, or books.  I don't need Star Wars to all be like Andor (though that would be cool), but I think there's a lot more that could be done with those archetypes than what we've seen so far.\n\n**Star Trek Lower Decks** continues to be great, though for the latest episode, \"Parth Ferengi's Hearth Place\" you may want to have finished Deep Space 9, because there's kinda some big spoilers for a couple characters after the end of DS9.  Mariner's character work is interesting, Boimler got some good jokes, and Freeman really got to shine at the end.\n\n\nStarted **Loki** like everyone else.  At this point I'm pretty much burnt out on all MCU/Star Wars stuff, but Loki S1 was a real bright spot, and Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, and Ke Huy Quan are fun to watch no matter what, so I'll give it a chance.  (Plus getting Eugene Cordero in Lower Decks and Loki together is cool!  That guy is canonically part of more universes than nearly any other actor I can think of!)",

I'll give them that, but they need people at the top who actually care so they know who to bring on board.\n\nAndor ended up being one of my all time favorite shows but there needs to be more consistent quality control or the franchise is going to find its historical clout won't carry it much longer.",

The 2nd episode has me more into the series. \n\n**Loki** this premiere has got to be one of the best Marvel episodes. A lot of mysteries and the acting was great. Also the CGI was good.

Still liked it, this was a really fun series that for me was purely popcorn TV.\n\n**Wheel of Time** also ended this week.  I'm sure some people hated it, but I thought the finale was just straight-up awesome.  The show continues to have some clunky moments, some things that look cheap, some goofy stuff, but I just don't care anymore.  I wish it had a budget comparable to stuff like the MCU shows.  But man, I was just amped up with energy after the finale, it was so much fun.  Huge turnaround from how the first season ended.  Really excited for the third season.\n\nHBO pushing stuff onto Netflix is working somehow, even though I have HBO.  Starting through **The Pacific** again, which I haven't watched since it first aired (and at the time, was just disappointed because **Band of Brothers** is IMO the best thing ever made for television).

I assume they're also up on Peacock. I'm enjoying them, but YMMV. Both just started up (they were developed off schedule and probably got 10-13 episodes done before the strikes).\n\n*The Irrational* is your typical quirky-intelligentsia consulting for the FBI type show, where Jesse L. Martin plays a professor of behavior science. Not dissimilar to *Instinct* or *True Lies.*\n\n*Found* is a sort of BLM twist on missing persons cases + the \"consult with a serial killer\" trope, where the show centers on an independent investigator (because the cops aren't effective in cases for missing PoC). Spoiler (which is, btw, in the trailer I linked to up above and is revealed at the end of the first episode); she was formerly abducted herself, but escaped >!and what her colleagues don't know is that she's consulting with her abductor, whom she's holding captive!<.\n\nOn the PBS side of things, we're just finishing up [Season 5 of *Unforgotten*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl47zcRao34)*,* where we see how the show survives without Nicola Walker; and next week, they start up S2 of Nicola Walker's new show, [*Annika*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDsMFMB17FA) (based on the BBC4 radio series, [*Annika Stranded*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b049fg98/episodes/player), with the same writer and star. And no, Nick Walker and Nicola Walker are not related).  Previously, [*D.I. Ray*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__uhz_oRa1M) and S1 and S2 of [*Before We Die*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB8JUfkHYsw) aired/dropped, and they were solid, but not spectacular.\n\nAnd if you missed AMC+ dropping [S3 of *Happy Valley*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9KkEfVZ9jk) back in May, you might want to go find that.  Easy to miss after a 6+ year hiatus between series. :) Because that would be what I'd rate as spectacular.\n\nYou've also only got until the 30th of October to catch S1 of [*Dark Winds*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9X4Xyb8JE) on Max.

                    "body": "The biggest show that scratched my Breaking Bad itch was The Night Manager. It's about a guy infiltrating the circle of an arms dealer and getting himself dug deep into heavy shit. By a one-line plot summary it doesn't have much in common, but it has that same air of a really taut suspenseful thriller with realistic consequences and motivations looming over everything.\n\nThe Sopranos is also similar in that it's really focused on a few criminal characters and their minds, how they think about and justify what they do, what motivates them, etc, and it seems like a clear influence on Breaking Bad. But it's a little less of a thriller and more in the character-study direction. Like a blend of Breaking Bad and Mad Men, if you've seen that. The Shield and Deadwood I would also put in this group of shows that scratch a Breaking Bad itch in their way.\n\nIf you like both Breaking Bad and The X-Files, try Mr. Robot. It's about a computer hacker that becomes embroiled in conspiracies to take down major corporations and \"reset\" global/US capitalism in certain ways by erasing debt records. It's got the crime thriller elements and tight serialized suspense of Breaking Bad plus the conspiratorial paranoia, pervasive uncertainty, and twists and turns of The X-Files.\n\nIf you like The X-Files and want more, or wish it were a little more coherent and exciting in its long-term tarrative, definitely try Fringe. It's very blatantly an X-Files inspired show, about an FBI agent investigating a pattern of bizarre and impossible events, but with a much tighter focus on hard sci-fi elements and building a consistent world, and really makes good use of its more out-there elements. (The one caveat is that the long-term narrative part doesn't *really* kick off until the first season finale, and before that it's more of an episodic thing with mysterious background links).",

            "body": "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel \n\nAmazing! \n\nAfter my GF and I binged watched it... Very surprisingly... I now have to say (for me personally) how it is among the top/best written TV shows I've ever seen. \n\nEssentially: \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe writing/dialog is so good, that it unfolds like an epic theater stage play. And while it's extremely dialog focused, the 1950's background visuals and costumes are stunning. It really immerses you completely into another era. (That show must have had a HUGE budget!?). \n\nNot to mention the actors--how practically every single one of them played their characters so well, I'd be really torn as to who to give the top award to? \n\nMidge or Susie Myerson? \n\nMoishe or Abe? Rose? (Also can't forget Luke Kirby as Lennie Bruce who had some pretty tragic dramatic moments.) \n\nSo ya... All of those characters were so well portrayed and fun to watch. They were at times funny over-the-top caricatures of themselves, but other times very human and much more indepth. \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAlso as for the characters: \n\nIt was an intriguing-journey to see them change/develop during the course of the show's seasons like that, in which some characters seem to have achieved a true epiphany, while others sort of regressed, with a lot of heart braking drama sometimes. \n\nAs for the comedy aspects: \n\nThose were hilarious, with constant underspoken yet clever zingers that sometimes come at you too fast that you have to rewind and replay a scene to catch all the nuances, or you just want to hear it again because it was so clever. \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nMy only complaints... \n\nThe first show was a bit on the too-weird side. So with Episode 1 I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. But after that, I was hooked. \n\nMy second complaint was that I didn't fully like the ending/last show episode either. \n\nBut other fans here really liked the ending, so probably most would disagree with me on that. Fair enough.  \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAnother problem with the ending is... Well... I guess... \n\nThe show was so good, that I just didn't want it to end! I would have loved to see the series continue into subsequent decades like more of the 80's, then into the 90's, 2000's... (so much material there), including some new characters, along with the evolving lives of her children perhaps... etc... \n\nOn this note, heck, I got carried away in my own musings, that I envisioned the show carrying on decades into the future with her grandkids, so you'd then have a series that evolved from an indepth immersive 1950's period drama/comedy, all the way to a futuristic SciFi show! Lol! (Like maybe her daughter could play a role in a future breakthrough...)\n\nBut alas... The series ended... And it was a good solid run of 5 seasons. \n\nMany would say it was the perfect length to tell the epic story of those intriguing character's lives. \n\nWell worth the watch.",

Honestly, even better than season 1!\n\nFoundation S2 - It\u2019s a great show, even though it tries to appear more intellectual than it actually is.

Navy SEAL who was accused of killing civilians and war crimes in Iraq.  I remember following this story as it was happening on the news at the time but once the third epsiode rolled, I realized that much of the story flew under the national news radar.  I was blindsided by the fourth episode and don't remember any of this information being reported on at the time. \n\nThe Big Door Prize- I don't recall hearing much about this show at all and yet it is now one of my favorite shows on Apple.  I wasn't even sure what it was about when I started watching and thought it might be some sort of game show due to the name.  It is not.  TBDP is a dramedy about a small town in which a mysterious coin operated \"Life Potential\" machine pops up in the local grocery store and turns the resident's lives upside down based on the machines's predictions. Each episode focuses on a different resident and how these vague (often a single word) predictions impact them and the people around them. Really glad this got a renewal for a second season. \n\nSuspicion- I'm not really sure what to make of this show.  I thought the actors generally did a good job and were the only things saving the show from the hamfisted plot.  The show wrapped up all the plot lines and works as a one and done mini-series for anyone thinking of watching it.\n\nLiaison- Really enjoyed this short Eva Green/Vincent Cassell spy thriller show. Everything wraps up tidily after 6 episodes so it seems likely that this will be a mini-series rather than a multi-season show.  \n\nDrops of God.  Enough has been written about this show that I don't need to add anything else.  I enjoyed it.\n\nSurface- I'm kind of surprised this got renewed for a 2nd season but apparently this show was fairly popular for the service.  The first half of S1 is just so incredibly slow and reluctant to give out any information about the main mystery of a woman trying to make sense of her life after an incident that caused her to lose all of her memories though it does pick up a bit in the second half.  \n\nInvasion- I'm watching this weekly and it is still one of the most disappointing shows of the last few years. I don't know why I keep watching other than to make fun of how bad it is.  When you make a show with such unlikeable main characters, I'm secretly hoping the aliens win.  \n\nThe Changeling- It seems that I generally like this show more than most people.  It is a sort of modern fairy tale mystery box mixed with a bit of horror.  The detractors think it is too slow and dragging things out but I think they supply enough new information each episode to keep things interesting.  \n\nFor non-Apple shows, WoT S2 was much better than S1.  I wouldn't say it is a great show now, or even good, but I found myself eager to watch each new episode as it was released towards the end of the season which is something I could not say about S1.",

Something like *no one would do that* and the Paul Reiser says \"they can if you write them to do it\". Having read a bit about wilderness survival (shackleton/whaleship essex) this felt like such a cringe hollywood take on what is inherently dramatic and challenging. Sure, add in supernatural elements, like *The Terror* does, but don't ignore the struggle and then drop huge bombshells. And oh boy the hallucination trope, can we do it for every character in one season? \n\nBut it's stripped away to spin circles on a handful storylines that are super boring, and never go anywhere. And repeat that the next episode. And again. Any angle this show had on trauma got evaporated when they dropped in horrific stuff to compensate for their inability to write.

And for me at least, it was rather obvious from the first season that was not the direction this show was headed.\n\nAnd while I will admit it was a bit melodramatic at times, and there were some holes in the writing in S2, I still think the second season was a successful one, and I for one was impressed the writers managed to avoid making it too much of Young Adult drama.

            "body": "**Love on the Spectrum** (US, Season 1) on Netflix. A very cute, heartwarming show with a reasonably satisfactory ending for most parties. I do have some quibbles (shocker). My first is that I'm not 100% convinced that Subodh and Rachel and Abbey and Daniel have the mental capacity or ability to truly consent to sexual activity (assuming they're doing anything like that, which seems...somewhat unlikely) so putting them on a dating show edges towards exploitive. It can feel like they're imitating and going along with what others have said 100s of times about them wanting their children to marry, to have their own children, and to be \"normal\" and dating and mating is part of that. But I have genuine worry that they're not fully aware of what's going on. \n\nMy second bugbear is with the \"fan club\" over on the LOTS SubReddit for Steven. Steven is a doll. He's sweet as pie. There's no doubt about that. But I think every single person over there who says they'd date him or expresses romantic interest or is \"confused\" on why he can't find a woman is lying to themselves in a major way. Steven is not able to carry on a normal conversation, it's like talking to a Speak and Spell. He has very, very limited phrases he brings out and it's very slow pacing--torturously so. Also the literal tenor of his voice, which is gorgeous and melodious, is misleading--I suspect he's not actually all that easy-going like his voice would suggest (few people with Autism are). I want to shake everyone on that forum and ask them \"do you want to **FUCK** Steven? Because pretty much no straight woman does. Be real.\" He has ZERO heterosexual energy. Zero. I was startled when he appeared on screen and asked my husband (who already watched the show) \"Oh! is he gay?\" I would be *good money* he's...not straight, let's put it that way. \n\n**Wilderness** on Prime. This by the numbers dark, glossy thriller is 100% predictable. There are NO twists. None. Everything you think is going to happen...happens. There's not even cliffhangers because it's so predictable! But it's fun and the actors are doing a decent job. \n\n**In search of a Flat Earth** documentary on YouTube. The first 40 minutes are captivating and genuinely moving--the maker is not alone in being choked up and moved by the sight of scientific proof happening right in front of his eyes. The rest is very, very solid as well. I recommend it! \n\nLooking forward to \"Delicate\" (I waited until there was 2 episodes to catch up on) and keeping up with RHONY and RHOSLC! Also interested in \"Shelter\" (Harlan Coben-based TV show) although all the other shows based on his stuff are merely okay.",

Same with Perin and Rand. Egwene was my favourite of them all, her scenes were always the best this season, very cathartic. I felt like there were so many plot holes. Don't even get me started about this whole Heroes of the Horn thing that came out of nowhere. While the fighting scenes were cool, the plot just didn't make a lot of sense. The only thing that excites me for next season is the release of the rest of the forbidden and hopefully these 5 main characters develop their powers further so they become an actual 'threat' to the forbidden.!< I know a lot of the book readers will dislike my review, but it is what it is.\n\n**2) Gen V Season 1 Ep 4: (8/10)** \\- honestly, while the vibes are similar to The Boys, i'm just not feeling the main character (Marie), I can't put my finger on it but she's not super likeable lol. I really liked the relationship between Emma and Sam and their scenes together. Best part of the episode was  >!Tek Knight lol, esp when it all clicked at the end what his fetish was haha. I love that they gave more spotlight to super enhanced sense abilities. Overall, enjoyable (the exploding d\\*\\*\\* was a cherry on the top).!<\n\n**3) Castlevania Nocturne Season 1 (binged it all (7/10)** \\- Hmm it was entertaining but nothing outstanding like the OG castlevania. It also just felt a lot shorter and more rushed? Characters aren't quite fleshed out as much. I am still looking forward to season 2 tho. Good watch to pass time.",

Egwene's arc gets a jumpstart with what happened to her this season, but a lot of the rest of them are very slow burns.\n\nAs an example, Mat (a fan-favorite in the books and a main character) doesn't have a single PoV chapter until the third book of the series.  Perrin's main arc doesn't really get underway until the fourth book.",

Egregious actors and acting, most if not all actors are insufferable. No acting happened in the whole season, they all sounded like they're reading from the same large boring script written by teenagers, and most of the performances have frozen facial expressions. A typical character in this show can be happy, sad, scared, horny, and you can't tell the difference by looking at them.\n\nRegarding the story, it's about some fictional universe where all women have superpowers and men don't or for some stupid reason \"are not allowed\" to have these powers because it doesn't serve well the feministic undertone of the show I guess. The objective is to find the \"dark one\" which purpose and definition are unclear, but seems to be a male villain with superpowers which can summon and control a bunch of minotaurs they call \"trollocs\".\n\nI dropped it after watching the first season, complete waste of time, 0/10.",

That's all I can say. \n\nI'm a huge fan of The Boys but I feel like the appeal of that show is that it subverts the basic superhero trope. All of the supes are based off Justice League characters so their powers are standard, and the drama and storylines comes from the fact that the superheroes are actually narcissistic psychopaths and humans have to take them down.\n\nGen V is a show about young superheroes who are goodhearted, but their superpowers tie in to things people might struggle with or are social topics.  Bulimia, self harm, gender fluidity, etc.  So a lot of scenes can have discussions revolving around those topics. \n\nThe humans (adults) seem to be the bad guys and the supes (young people) are the good guys. So it's more like X-Men, or any other show about young mutants.  It honestly reminds me of the \"New Mutants\" movie.\n\nIt's not unwatchable though. It's fine. I just don't feel like it's doing anything new that hasn't been done by other superhero shows, or hasn't been done by The Boys (weird and shocking sex kinks and people exploding into showers of blood)\n\n I wouldn't say it's trash. Just not on the same level as The Boys and is basically just another superhero show I'm watching.",
