Not everything worked for me but enough did that I quite enjoyed this one and will definitely return for a second season. \n\n**Griselda** - I enjoyed this limited series. It was an engaging crime drama. Sofia Vergara was pretty good in a dramatic role! No idea if this was a good biopic as I admit I had little knowledge of Griselda Blanco going into this one but it was definitely a good TV series. \n\n**All the Light We Cannot See** - I really liked the captivating WW2 drama set in occupied France. The story sucked me right in and had a great balance between hope and despair. Ruffalo and Laurie were good in their roles but I thought it was the younger actors Aria Mia Loberti and Louis Hofmann who turned in the best performances. I was surprised to see critics so down on the show considering how much I enjoyed it. I was unfamiliar with the book so I\u2019m going to chalk the lacklustre critical reception down to it not being a great adaptation of the original book but I definitely felt like this was a good TV show. \n\n**Halo s1** - I\u2019ve been rewatching the first season of Halo to get me ready for the new season. I still love this sci-fi show. Reminds me a bit of Raised by Wolves. It is not perfect but it looks fantastic and there is plenty of fun to be had with the characters, story, and the visuals. I\u2019m looking forward to jumping into the second season later tonight! I know this is not Redditors favourite show but I think I\u2019m getting on so well with it because I\u2019ve never played the Halo game it was based upon. \n\nTurns out it was a week I spent enjoying adaptations of movies, books, true life stories, and games that I had zero knowledge of going into and that seems to have been a benefit for me in terms of enjoying them for what they are if the general reviews are anything to go by because all four were pretty good! \n\nNext up more **Halo** then I\u2019ll stick with sci-fi as I\u2019m circling **Three-Body Problem**, **The Signal**, and **Twisted Metal**.",

Sort of like Westworld but more subtle without the overt HBO sex and violence.)  In a lot of ways the story is kind of cliche, but it just goes to show that if the execution is really good then an unoriginal story can really still work.  The performances are really good (though I assume people complained about Rebecca Ferguson's inconsistent accent) and the sets are so detailed that it looks like it was done with a movie-level budget, not TV.  Since I binged it any slower parts in middle didn't cause any problem (they were needed to give the show time to breathe and to advance characters and backstory.)  If watching wekly I can see how you might get a bit frustrated by that.\n\n**Shogun** - Up to date and it remains excellent.  The most recent episode is definitely slower with so much time and focus spent on things like the rituals the courtesan did.  But overall I still found it quite good.

I found the finale not so enthralling tbh, I don't feel like it was on the same level as the rest of the show, but maybe that's because we've grown accostumed to fancy cliffhanger-y season finales. I don't know if this could qualify as \"hard sci-fi\". I said it was provocative, which in many instances translates as being quite ridiculous in terms of dialogues, plot points, or even entire characters (I'm looking at you, Wade).

Riley Keough kills it as a lead, plus it delves into the life of a law student and intern turned sex worker and the consequences that follow. Hell, even the sex scenes were done tastefully. While some are excessive (the final episode is the main offender of this >!half of the episode is an elaborate cuckold scene and not much else!<) some straight up skip past it and show characters putting on clothes.  \n\n\nIt does peter out towards the end with bad pacing, starting from episode 9. Plus the final episode is easily my least favorite for the reasons in the spoiler above.  \n\n\nTL;DR Great acting from the lead actress, her life as sex worker, intern, law student, and trying to juggle all three kept me interested, sadly falls off with bad pacing and damn near nothing burger of an ending to top it off  \n\n\n6/10  \n\n\nI've no desire to watch the other two seasons though, since I've heard they're lackluster.",

I am not a book reader so this is all very new and fascinating for me. For some book readers, it it was too short and not faithful enough to the books but I think they did well. I read a lot of articles and wiki on this and I think it would not be so interesting if I did not get Oxford 5 but the original characters in the book instead especially since there is very little interactions between them. Some also pointed that the Chinese version 30 episodes is better BUT I really do not think I want to watch 30 hours just to get to episode 5 of this show. So TDLR, I like this and perhaps it might be better if we get 10 episodes but 8 is fine.\n\nI do hope they break book 3 into 2 seasons but it really depends on the ratings for this season.\n\n2. Apples never fall\n\nAnother show that critics did not like but I find it is enjoyable. It is not top notch and I watch this before 3 body problem. I also like the ending which is slightly different from the book.\n\nYet to start/complete\n\n1. Halo Season 2. Enjoyed S1 but no time to get to S2 yet\n2. Extraordinary. Finish S1 last year but did not like it as much as some here so not sure if I want to watch S2.\n3. Feud. I only have 2 episodes left so I probably finish it. Only watch because of the stellar cast.\n\nStill no time to try girls on the bus and Manhunt. I do want to try at least 1 episode to see if I like them.\n\nGiven up\n\nConstellation (Watch 4 episodes)",

            "body": "**The Regime on Max:** I swear critics expect the moon from HBO. This show is very watchable but it's getting iffy to poor reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the balance of power shift, shift again, and then back again in the court games and plottings and manipulations in this fake country. Yes, it's OTT and ridiculous and it bears some resemblance to \"Veep\". However, there can be more than one show about a self-absorbed princess of a politician and the people who enable and love her. I mean, how many shows have we had about the police and the FBI?!? I blew through all three episodes in a single night. \n\n**3 Body Problem on Netflix:** ultra-strong until episode 5, then starts to sag. Hope it picks up again. But it's a fun joyride. Again, astronomically high standards seem to be an issue here with reviews, even casual ones online--like saying the \"world\" of the video game feels empty. It's a device that a certain group is using to prove a very extended metaphor/allegory/proving ground. It doesn't need to be super-detailed! It works better barren! Anyway, aside from the minor gripe that absolutely ZERO actual working scientists are anywhere near as telegenic as this crew, it's a delightful show. I plowed through 3 episodes in one night and am on 7/8 right now. \n\n**The Americans on Hulu (first time):** After the SA scene in episode one when it was first out/first on DVD/first in re-runs I noped out. I was really tired of SA as a plot device. I decided to give the show another chance. It's very solid. My slight issue is that it feels...low stakes sounds ridiculous, but it's hard to fully suspend disbelief because we know how the cold war ended--and all these maneuvers and frantic scramble efforts are for NOTHING or for very little (maybe that's part of the show's point?). I'd also like to understand more why Elizabeth and Phillip who have been in the USA for 20+ years, aren't converted/defected, why they are still spies/enemies. What about Communist Russia, which is shown to be awful for Elizabeth at least, was so great? Wouldn't the brainwashing have worn off? They're living the LIFE in the USA! Anyway, I'll keep watching.",

He was born for the role, which is ironic because by all accounts he couldn't have been more different as a person than Tony and was a stand-up guy that the rest of the cast loved to work with.\n\nMy absolute favorite show ever, I'm glad you enjoyed it.",

And the first half of Season 4 is great, successfully escalating things while keeping the focus on characters, and the episode The Constant remains a masterpiece. \n\nBut man, after the halfway point of Season 4 (which is exactly when the writers strike began), the show takes such a nosedive. It's suddenly a tangled mess of storylines with no payoffs, long stretches where it feels like nothing is happening, and a dramatic shift from \"a show about characters with fantasy things happening\" to \"a fantasy show with some people in it,\" which kinda ruins what the show was about.  Not to mention, they take one of the best characters on the show (John Locke) and absolutely destroy him.\n\nI feel like if Lost had been only four seasons, and had more focus, it would have gone down as one of the best shows ever.
