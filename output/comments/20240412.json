I'm loving the Japanese actors in this show.\n\n**Fallout S1 (Amazon)** \\-- it's been a long time since I binge-watched a show in just two days. It really captured the wacky post-apocalyptic vibe of the videogames. Great cast too and I'm just amazed by the size of Ella Purnell's expressive eyes. Her eyes remind me of an anime version of Bette Davis, but Purnell's eyes might be even bigger.\n\n**Poker Face Ep 1 to 8 (Peacock)** \\-- Almost finished with Poker Face and I'm really enjoying the old school mystery-of-the-week format. I barely remember Columbo as a child, from where the show takes its inspiration from, but I remember really liking the disarming charm of Columbo as a detective, and Natasha Lyon's character is also equally captivating with her unique ability to spot bullshit.  I also love all the meta references to different films and other TV shows.\n\n**Cyberpunk Edgerunners Ep1 to Ep 4 (Amazon)** \\-- I'm halfway through and enjoying it so far, I decided to buy the videogame. The setting and (violent) tone of the show reminds me of the Japanese version of a Heavy Metal story. It would also fit right in with the Love Death + Rocket's Netflix anthology, which also captures the Heavy Metal vibe (of the 1980s animated sci-fi anthology film).",

This is sort of like a network television Reacher but it suprisingly kind of works mainly because of Justin Hartley who completely carries this thing. CBS already renewed this for a Season 2 so viewership must be high. \n\nParish (AMC): Man what a dud of a show this is. This show has potential but the acting outside of Skeet Ulrich and Giancarlo feels stale, the plot feels predictable and this doesn\u2019t work as a serious crime drama or an entertaining watch so it has like nothing going for it.

That opening scene of the bombs dropping was incredible and I think the kid deserves some credit because she looked absolutely horrified and it really instilled that sense of horror people would have seeing a nuke go off that close to them.\n\nWhat I did not expect was for the second episode to start out doing two things: >!One, make me feel sympathy for someone from the goddamn Enclave. That doctor was protecting a puppy and raising her as his own so she wouldn't be incinerated which... Fuck the Enclave for incinerating puppies that are under 10lbs. Bastards. Also, was that a Super Mutant hand? Two. A fucking Assaultron to show up while Lucy is slowly making her way through the wastelands. Those things haunt anyone who has played Fallout 4, especially the Assaultron Dominators. Fucking invisible robots that can two hit kill you... Ah, they've done a great job with this show.!<\n\nAlso, was pleasantly surprised to see a non-binary character with Aspirant Dane but holy fuck, what was done to them was GRIM! What sadistic bastard does something like that?! Come to think of it... Something about Maximus here: >!Was his hiding in a fridge meant to be a reference to Fallout 4's Billy who hid in a fridge when the bombs dropped or was it more of the lead-lined fridge thing that people used to say was a thing?!<\n\nHonestly, I'm already impressed at how accurate they've managed to get so much of the vibe of Fallout into the show. It's genuinely surprising how well they did it and I cannot wait to see more of Walton Goggins as well because hoo boy, that first scene of him as The Ghoul? I'm already sold.\n\nEDIT: Small update. About halfway into Episode 2 and they LOVE putting little easter eggs and references in here for people who played the games. I just spotted someone reading the Wasteland Survival Guide!",

Event the way dirt mountains fill the abandoned houses makes me think \"yeah there's where my character would get stuck and I'd have to reload a save\" or seeing all the uesless trinkets and thinking \"those are the useless junk I'd accidentally loot\"  It even feels like characters use VATS in some of the gun fights. \n\nI think there was some minor outrage about some retcon they did about the NCR/Brotherhood relating to the New Vegas games which I haven't noticed yet but I'm honestly not too worried about that. \n\nTop notch performances from Walton Goggins and Ella Purnell.

If anything the show retconned FO3 & 4s Brotherhood, which Bethesda turned a bit into saviours. Which they were not in FO1,2&NV. They just wanna gatekeep all pre-war technology, and are usually pretty secretive and mistrust strangers outside of the order.\n\nPeople are more upset over the NCR supposedly not existing anymore, but I don't think the show is saying that.

The only downside is that there are a lot of subtitles, but I love the sense of authenticity.\n\nThey really went all out to make it feel authentic, and the actors are excellent. The violence and intrigue is on the level of *Game of Thrones*, minus the undead and dragons and such. There's not as much sex as in *Game of Thrones*, but there's some.\n\nI started watching the Chinese series *Three Body* on YouTube. Again, there are subtitles, this time for everything, since it's in Chinese. It's a thorough adaptation of Cixin Liu's science fiction classic *The Three Body Problem*, 30 episodes long. It does move somewhat slowly, but I like it so far. The Netflix adaptation of the same book in English, *3 Body Problem*, is only 8 episodes long, and I decided I wanted the longer version that's more faithful to the book. But I may watch both eventually.\n\nI recently watched *Hot Ones* on YouTube, the latest episode with Conan O'Brien. On *Hot Ones* celebrities are interviewed while eating hot wings (or veggie wings if requested) as the sauces get hotter and hotter. If you've watched even a few episodes of *Hot Ones* before, you will be amazed, floored, gob-smacked, and highly amused at Conan's performance.\n\nI've never before seen host Sean Evans at a loss for words. On the other hand, if you've never watched *Hot Ones*, you shouldn't start with this episode. You should watch a few other shows to see celebrities in pain, *then* watch Conan O'Brien. Conan's performance is indescribable, but amazing, and hilarious. He's a real showman.\n\nI always watch *Last Week Tonight with John Oliver* on Max. If you don't have Max they put much of the show -- the main story -- on YouTube as well.\n\nI'm watching Trever Noah's latest Netflix special, \"Where Was I.\" My wife and I watch comedy specials together at dinner. We also liked Netflix specials by Leanne Morgan, John Mulaney, Sebastian Maniscalo, and Nate Bargatze. We often watch *Saturday Night Live* on Sunday, too, although I tend to turn it off after \"Weekend Update.\"\n\nI always enjoy watching PBS's *Antiques Roadshow*. I also watched *Chicago Stories: The Birth of Gospel*, which I enjoyed.\n\nI watched some games in both the men's and women's NCAA basketball tournaments, and now I'm watching the Masters golf tournament. I watch NBA basketball from time to time, and will be watching more when the postseason starts on April 20.\n\nAnd that's about it. For some reason I think I don't watch much TV, but that's actually a lot more than I realized.",

It's not one of my very favorites, but it's still compelling. Since it won so many awards, my interest is piqued. I'm on season 2 so far, and I like Roman because he's the most amusing of the Roy characters IMO. I like Kieran Culkin. Cousin Greg is a welcome breath of fresh air. On the other hand,  I know none of the Roys are supposed to be likeable but I hate Kendall with the fire of a thousand suns! He's so blah and depressed and just...weirdly brooding all the time.

            "body": "**The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live**\n\nIt's funny, back when they announced that they were basically taking the original series, and splitting it up into 3 different series, I thought it was an excessive overkill for a show that was long past its prime already.  However, with each successive series, I've felt more and more grateful for that decision.  It's allowed them to really focus on the characters, and dynamics that really worked in the original, and giving them fully fleshed-out stories, rather than sharing too much screen-time with characters less interesting characters.\n\nIn this case, the Rick/Michonne dynamic really shines.  I like how they kind of evolved Rick's character since the time he left the original series, so that at the start it's hard to see how much of the character we knew has survived, and how this plays into his dynamic with Michonne, and her attempts to rescue him from the group that took him.  I could see some frustration in this regard, particularly near the middle of the season, but the writing, and especially acting between the two are strong enough that it's more gripping than anything.  Given the ending, I could see this being a one-and-done series, and I'd be perfectly happy with that possibility, but if they did end up making another season, I hope they're able to come up with something worthwhile to carry their story forward.\n\n**Mr. and Mrs. Smith**\n\nI never saw the movie this was based on, but I thought this was an enjoyable series overall.  In this case, while the spy action was generally well done, that part of the story seemed to be largely there to inform the evolving dynamics of the two main characters.  I admittedly felt that some of the episodes were a bit long-winded in this regard, while in other ways their story could have used some more time to get fleshed-out (which would make later turns in the story have more impact), but as a whole it was a solid season, with a great dynamic between the characters, supported by nice acting.\n\n**Ark: The Animated Series**\n\nI've actually never played the game this is based on, so bear that in mind.  That being said, I thought this was an enjoyable overall.  The world-building was nicely done, using the main character Helena to ease the viewers into things.  It does have its rough spots, but once the story gets going.  And while some of the cast is better than others, I do think that aspect was good overall.  I particularly liked Michelle Yeoh's character Mei-Yin, who had some of the most compelling development on the show.  Zahn McClarnon's character was also nicely done IMO.  Admittedly I wouldn't say this is among the better videogame series I've seen, but I'd say it holds its own in that regard, at least for someone who can't compare it to the source material.",

I will say I feel Andrew Scott is suddenly being crammed down our throats at every turn, like Anya Taylor Joy, Florence Pugh, Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler, (pretty much the cast of Dune II, actually now that I think about it) but he seems to be a solid talent so no real complain there.\n\n**Grand Caymans** (reality show) on Hulu (Freeform) okay this is soapy, reality-show nonsense and I'm here for it.

It is not something which has held up well in terms of offensiveness, but it's up there with Trailer Park Boys in terms of how funny it is.\n\nSaw the latest episode of **Star Trek: Discovery**, and I wish the series was more episodic. I don't care about this plotline or these villains, and we're probably stuck with them all season. Also, it really sucks when the Star Trek writers forget that this is a science fiction show, and go full bore into mysticism and fantasy. You don't get to yada-yada away science while being a science fiction show. If you want to talk about spiritualism and religion, that's fine, but there being things which are unknown does not justify leaning on the trope that maybe things don't need answers, or maybe religions are actually right in the way they respond to the unknown with myth and faith. That idea is antithetical to science, and to Star Trek as a show premised on the idea that cultural and scientific progress is good actually. This episode really sucks, and it reminds me of the part of DS9 I hated, which was the whole prophets, Bajoran religion, and pah wraiths thing.",

It takes you on a little tour through the wasteland, much like the games would. Its not just a vehicle for a showrunner to flex narrative muscles for industry cred(*cough* The Witcher *cough*), but actually made with respect towards the source material *and* the fans of the franchise. \n\nAnd I'm not just talking it looking the part, or references. I'm talking scenes that you straight up don't fully understand if you haven't played one of the games before. Like the doctor healing the guy's foot(broken limb) with his *doctor's bag*. For anyone not familiar with the games, this would just be some weird miracle tonic he pours over the foot to magically make it heal. \n\nAs said, it looks amazing. Has a really good cast and good characters(Maximus had way more depth to him than I thought he would), and while the overall story of the \"hunt for the item\" is just typical and ok, the episodes themselves were well written.\n\nI appreciate the show returning the Brotherhood to its pre-Bethesda self, of not being the heroes, but being a bunch of techno extremists who believe that nobody should have access to any (pre-war) technology except them. On the other hand though, the NCR change I don't like that much. The lady would've better fit into the Followers of the Apocalypse, as they actually want to help people. The NCR only cares for its own citizens and wouldn't help *everyone*. But its not really much of an issue for me. \n\nOne thing that gets heavily critized online is the change from the Chinese (communists) dropping the bombs, to Capitalism dropping the bombs. Not even subtle but a straight up capitalist conspiracy. I do get the complaints and wouldn't debate them, but nonetheless the change still kinda fit the universe for me. And ultimately, I dont think it matters who dropped the first bomb. \n\nOnly episode I didn't like was the final one, which felt a bit clunky for me. The observatory looked like a typical stage set and the endless exposition dump wasn't really that interesting. But I'm definitely looking forward to S2. If only just for more Walton Goggins goodness. \n\n**Ripley**\n\nThis has captivated me more than anything else in a long time. Its a work of art. Like watching an 8 episode stage play. \n\nI loved the slow place, the long shots taking their time, and the overall quietness of it. Its beautifully shot and orchestrated. \n\nI don't remember which critic said that the main actor lacks screen presence, but they're insane. He's absolutely nailing this psychopath. His stare, is body language, it is a really haunting performance. And the actor playing Dickie is maybe even my favorite here. Because he isn't just playing a jaded rich kid, living an easy life. He *is* one. Its amazing performances all around. \n\nI've really read anything related to the character, but now I'm really thinking I should catch up. I did see the Talented Mr. Ripley once but I remember not liking it that much because it was too blatant for me in the way how Dickie really was a dick etc. After this one, I think I'd enjoy it even less. \n\nMuch like Fallout though, the final episode wasn't my favorite of the bunch. Mainly due to the masquerade bit. I just found it a little bit too much.",

It has genuinely good characters that develop over the season, and the appeal is more or less through them: at its core its a character drama, with an overarching plot to drive it. It's easier to get into it if you have seen the pilot/other extra content, like angel dusts comic and music video, because they give pre-background as to who the characters are, what their motivation is, etc. I think that the show did this super egregiously with angel dust, because before episode 4 you don't see any of his abuse or reasons for staying at the hotel, despite it being clearly outlined in his prequel comic and the addict music video. It just makes it seem like he's some deadbeat sex addict who's staying at the hotel for free rent, when in reality he is more or less trying to escape from valentino, who constantly sexually and physically abuses him. Basically what I'm saying is that the show doesn't do a very good job of introducing itself, so stick it for a couple more episodes and see what you think of it then.",

One criticism I had was that they declawed a pivotal scene (S2 Ep 5-8 Spoilers: >!The Lizard League massacre wasn't a massacre after all, as everyone survived!<). Part of that twist was predictable, but part of it was stupid. As for Ep 8 itself, man, the opening sequence was nerve-wracking and sickening. Just when I thought I was too desensitized by the internet... this show knows how to get to me.\n\nManhunt Ep 5 still chugging along. JWB and the Abe flashbacks are the best parts of the show for me. It's an interesting structure, where the main villain and hero come into conflict in episode 1, and the rest of the story is about dealing with the fallout. I also love to see Glenn Morshower cast against type. Tobias Menzies is fine, but has no material. I'm sick of the \"brilliant detective hampered by crippling physical ailment which always kicks in whenever we don't want to film a chase scene\" trope; I just dealt with that in Broadchurch.\n\nSpeaking of that trope, enjoying the weirdness of Sugar. It's short and should be a binge show, not a week-to-week bizarro mystery. I don't know what it is - some shows really lend themselves to the weekly in-depth discussions, while some don't. I am so glad that I was around for weekly episode talks around Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, for example, but I just don't find the need to go over Sugar's (gonna spoiler this just in case: >!supernatural twist. Is he a werewolf or in the matrix or a space alien or an AI in training?!< I have no idea and only barely care). The editing is jarring enough that it's keeping me interested. I think it works as a kind of (I'll spoiler it again just in case: >!satire!< of noir detective stories).\n\nAlso finished Tokyo Vice Season 1! On to Season 2. Completely engrossed in this show. I love Josh \"Jake\" Adelstein as this reckless asshole protagonist, Miyamoto the slimeball rock star detective, and many more. Top quality show, and really weird to watch at the same time as:\n\nShogun! I mean, obviously, it's the prestige show of the minute, what else is there to say about it?

It's sinful to suggest this, but if you didn't care for Season 1 or dropped it because it was a slow burn, 2 might fit your fancy. Two, I like how some characters from Season 2 are almost mirror characters of 1. For example: Portia/Quinn (both are screen addicted but one had no inclination to stop, the other wanted to stop and get out of a funk), Valentina/Armond >!(Both Hotel Managers are queer, one is open about it, the other slowly embracing their sexuality) !<  \n  \nWhat I didn't like was how less involved staff was in the plot (especially the Hotel Manager this time around) and how this time The White Lotus I felt was demoted to backdrop, it was more so the locals: Luci; the sex worker who i wished bathe with a toaster >!(I know it's White Lotus and a lot of characters that are jerks that don't get comeuppance but I really couldn't stand her)!<and Mia; the aspiring singer that was the weak cohesion that linked the characters together. Sure season 1's connection between characters were somewhat loose but in 2 even less so.\n\nThis season was far hornier than the first, but I don't find that good or bad, just an observation lol. That said, tl;dr cool ideas, better pacing, but the white lotus and it's staff taking a backseat, and the loose cohesion of characters, I just can't be arsed. I'll be back for season 3, 2 wasn't bad...just disappointing.\n\nDon't worry, it's only positive from here, and I'll try to keep it short and sweet:\n\n**Abbott Elementary** Binged Season 1 and 2 with my SO whose an educator who put me on this. Gutbusting work com identical to 'The Office'. Not an episode goes by where I have to pause to laugh. Tyler James Williams still has it from his 'Everybody Hates Chris' days. His defeated looks at the camera makes me crack up.\n\n**Fallout** Might be one of my favorite video game adaptations. Walter Ghoulgins and Ella \"Okey Dokey\" Purnell knock it out of the park with performances, the set pieces, tone, and everything else is very faithful to the game. Tempted to play New Vegas again Spoilers from the game warning: >!Even with the continuity snarl!<\n\n**X-men '97** I want Marvel to stop working on MCU (I love the series...until Endgame) and put all their efforts into animation because boy howdy, 3 episodes in and absolute banger. \n\n**Baby Reindeer**  Gonna spoil since this is fresh and it's best to go in blind but it's *not* for the faint of heart.

However, the narratives are actually weird similar: tall, handsome, competent, wealthy, and violent men are faced with a series of challenges to their missions, respectively freeing the family manor from a drug syndicate and infiltrating and undermining an enemy power. They respond to these challenges in the same way: with murder, betrayal, cunning and a slight nod to some moral purpose as a justification for their actions. Really, though, we know 'the action is the juice' as Heat told us and both characters love the muck.\n\nDespite being ostensibly aimed at very different audiences, both male leads are constantly being told, in story by other characters, how competent, handsome, and brave they are. Male characters envy them and the female characters want to be with them. The major difference is that Spy Family, an anime aimed at teenagers/young adults, actually interrogates the lead a bit more, showing the effects of his duplicitious lifestyle on himself and his family, where the tone of 'The Gentleman' is completely bizarre to me in 2024, with the main character essentially embarks upon the Walter White journey but played totally straight by the show, with no judgement, irony, or real consequences for this nepo baby mudering, torturing and assaulting people (all bad guys though, no worries) and using migrant slave labour for his drug business. \n\nI suppose in the end I enjoyed both shows in their own ways but The Gentleman, in particular, left me with a bad taste in my mouth and the Guy Ritchie formula is starting to fray at the seams more than a little with its mix of silliness, Brit-bullshit and brutality. Spy Family is strictly for those who can handle anime jank including a lot of sexism but it does have decent bit of charm and some funny running gags, although 24 episodes is about 10 too many.",

It captures exactly what it feels like to explore the wasteland. Dry deadpan dark humor. Absurdity. It never feels too try hard or disrespectful of the source material. Halfway through and excited to finish. \n\nPhysical 100 s2- Haven't seen this show mentioned but it's one of my favorite Netflix shows. It's a Korean reality show pitting 100 of the fittest athletes/influencers/celebrities against each other in a competition of physicality and it's awesome. The contestants are constantly complimenting each other and are so humble, I feel like if it was an American show it would be filled with drama and sex and all kinds of fluff but this show has none of that to really highlight the amazing athleticism of the contestants. Such a good show to throw on and just chill watching. \n\nShogun - I've stopped after ep. 7 to let the last 3 episodes air so I can finish them in one sitting. Can't wait to see where it goes.

My only complaint is that the season starts off a little slow and unfocused but it quickly shifts into gear; a lot of beautifully-shot episodes this year, as well. High recommendation.\n\n**Fallout Season 1 (Amazon Prime Video)**\n\nWell, I can't really fairly judge this only getting two episodes in but I'll echo the guys at The Watch podcast who were wondering who this is for beyond fans of the game. It seems competently done but, for me having only played a couple of dozen of hours of Fallout 4 many years ago, it doesn't really seem to have a motivating factor beyond faithfully rendering various aspects of the game franchise into live action. \n\nThe stagey sets and practical effects also remind me a lot of a peak-artifice Tim Burton films with heavily costumed actors capering around over-elaborate sets.

It is a solid show that I wouldn't recommend to everybody, but, again, knowing that you love Justified and The Shield, I think you'll like it.\n\nThat said, Walton Goggins has a small (though amazing) role in Sons as an emotionally-moving transgender character. In about 5-10 episodes, I think. Out of about 90 episodes total.\n\nHe is *very good* in it though. But he isn't like an action hero, like some of the other stars, or anything like that.
