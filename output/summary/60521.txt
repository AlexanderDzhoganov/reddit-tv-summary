A mediocre superhero show with a "diverse" twist, where the CGI budget seems to have disappeared faster than the characters' backstories 🦸‍♂️💸. Commenters are divided between those who praise its "proper London" vibes and those who can't get past the lackluster effects and clichéd storylines. Maybe they should spend less time on "significant character development" and more on a coherent plotline.
