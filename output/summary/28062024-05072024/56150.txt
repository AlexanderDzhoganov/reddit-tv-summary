🎉 **Interview with the Vampire**: Now with 200% more brooding and 100% more dramatic pauses! Last week's comments were an *ode* to Assad Zaman's "evil gremlin" act in the '70s flashback and gushing over Jacob Anderson's "perfectly balanced" performance. This week, our intellectual giants are back, having finally realized Season 2 is a gem after sleepwalking through Season 1. 🛌✨ 

Apparently, re-watching Season 1 is now a thing because *suddenly* it’s not background noise anymore but a masterclass in subtle storytelling. Kudos to the brave soul who ventured to call Claudia's accent "horrific" amid a sea of hyperbole. Ah, the evolution from casual viewers to dedicated deconstructors. What a time to be undead! 🧛‍♂️🍷
