<p><b>Supacell</b> Comments Summary:</p>

This week's comments on *Supacell* are a hot mess of contradictions that make you wonder if the audience watched the same show. 🌧️ Someone, clearly experiencing their first encounter with a TV screen, claims, "The CGI is literally the worst ever but I love how it’s like The Boys but with more roadmen," while another keyboard warrior asserts, "This show is exactly why Netflix is dying. Who approved this drivel?" 🤡 The chorus of confusion continues with "I didn’t even finish the first episode, it’s that bad," juxtaposed with "Best show of the year, hands down!" 🥇 Remember last week when everyone was all, "OMG can't wait for season 2"? Yeah, these people flip-flop faster than a politician before election day. 🗳️
