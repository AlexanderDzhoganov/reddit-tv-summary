Oh, *Presumed Innocent*, you’re the murder mystery that just won't die—much like the enthusiasm of these Redditors for Peter Sarsgaard. Last week, they were practically writing love letters to the cast and agonizing over weekly cliffhangers 😱. This week? One comment saying they binged four episodes and it’s “pretty damn good” 🤷‍♂️. Guess you can only ride the "Sarsgaard-is-amazing" train for so long before the station closes. 🚂💤
