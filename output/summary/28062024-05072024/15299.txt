**The Boys**: This weekâ€™s comments make last week look like a love letter to the show. It seems our beloved anti-heroes have gone from "meh, it's still fun" to "someone stop this trainwreck." ðŸ’¥

Last week, our intrepid commentators were clinging to the hope that the season might, by some miracle, start making sense. Now, they're just begging for it to end before Homelander's facial twitches become the main plot point. "Spinning its wheels" seems to be the new mantra, and boy, the wheels are coming off. ðŸš—ðŸ’£

In conclusion: The Boys, like a fine cheese, has aged... terribly.
