Ah, *House of the Dragon*: the show that’s either "prime GoT" or "prequelitis mediocrity," depending on which way the wind blows. 🌬️ Last week, fans were practically writing sonnets about Paddy Considine's "extraordinary" Viserys and the "bananas" quality of the show. 🍌 Fast forward to this week, and the comments have been distilled to a sophisticated, "great" and "enjoying it." I guess when your dragon-based show’s weakest part *is* the dragons, brevity becomes a virtue. 💁‍♂️
