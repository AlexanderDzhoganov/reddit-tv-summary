ðŸŽ‰ *Dark Matter* fans have spoken again, and shocker: this week's comments are a roller coaster of unbridled enthusiasm and cringe-worthy cliches. Apparently, Joel Edgerton's "clear different feel" for each character (whatever that means) is now a masterclass in acting. Last week, the finale was "ok?" and now it's a "must-try for fans of quality sci-fi" with "realistic vibes." ðŸŒŒ Oh, and let's not forget the obligatory namedrop of *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*â€”because why not? Pro-tip: next time, make sure your parallel universe includes some coherent commentary. ðŸš€
