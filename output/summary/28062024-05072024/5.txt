This week on "True Detective: Night Country," the fanbase oscillates between grudging tolerance and outright disdain. One commenter extolled the "wonderful atmosphere" while another bemoaned the "script that seems to have been written by a moody teenager." The dialogue is "so bad it could cure insomnia," and the plot holes are "big enough to swallow Jodie Foster and her career." Last week's comments had at least a flicker of hope; this week, it's an abyss of disappointment. Even the die-hard fans are saying, "It's fine if you've already watched everything on Netflix... twice." 🤦‍♂️📺💀
