Oh look, *Hacks* is back this week, and apparently the commenters have collectively forgotten they had taste last week. ğŸ™„ One moment they're whining about "aimless" plots and "half-baked" jokes, now they're ğŸ¤© gushing over Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder like it's high art. ğŸ¥´ Last week it was "devolved into a sitcom" and this week it's "I forgot how much I missed this show." The amnesia is real, folks. ğŸ“ºâœ¨
