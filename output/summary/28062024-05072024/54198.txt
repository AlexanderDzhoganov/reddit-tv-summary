🍔 **The Bear** 🥪: Once a tantalizing gourmet meal, now reduced to a cold, stale sandwich no one asked for. Last week's culinary critics were lamenting how S3 was a pretentious parade of 🥄 *fart-sniffing chefs* preaching about luxury meals, while this week’s foodies are just praying S4 wraps things up before the show’s stars blow up. The consensus seems to be that S3 was the series equivalent of a Trent Reznor music video—lots of flash, no flavor, and stretched thinner than Carmy's patience. 🍽️ 

P.S. Can someone just send these characters to therapy already? 🛋️
