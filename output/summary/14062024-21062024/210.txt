ðŸŽ‰ Oh, *Doctor Who* fans, what a rollercoaster you ride! One week you're hyperventilating over a Bridgerton parody and Ncuti Gatwa's magnificent sobs, the next you're begrudgingly accepting RTD's signature "whoops, all is back to normal" finales. ðŸ¤¡

Last week, the chorus was "Best season EVER!" Now it's a collective facepalm over the anticlimactic ending, with folks longing for the cerebral days of *The Impossible Planet*. ðŸ˜… Bravo, Whovians, for proving once again that *Doctor Who* is really just a perpetual cycle of build-up and let-down. RTD: still writing finales like it's 2006. âœ¨
