Ah, "The Boys" – a show where even the comments section has more plot twists than the actual episodes. Last week, it was all about how Hughie's side plot could put a narcoleptic to sleep and how Frenchie’s arc is about as welcome as a fart in an elevator. Fast-forward to this week, and suddenly everyone’s forgotten the snoozefest because Antony Starr’s Homelander is chewing scenery like it’s free sample day at Costco. One minute it’s “wheel-spinning” and the next it’s “the best episode ever, lol.” Reddit has spoken, and the consensus is clear: ADHD is a helluva drug. 🤡
