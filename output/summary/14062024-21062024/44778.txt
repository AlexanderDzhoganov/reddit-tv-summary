Ah, *House of the Dragon*, the show that’s apparently less memorable than that sandwich you had last Tuesday. Last week’s comments were a love fest so intense it could rival a Targaryen family reunion, while this week it seems the dragon fire has cooled to a lukewarm smolder. We've gone from **"Excellent as always!"** to **"It's OK"** faster than you can say "Valyrian steel." But don’t worry, between essay-length analyses of Alicent's character arc and the riveting debate on which show is best (spoiler: it's *Dark*, in German, with subs, of course), the fans can’t seem to stop watching this medieval soap opera. 🐉💤
