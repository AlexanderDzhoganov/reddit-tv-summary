🎬 Ah, "The Bear" is back, and so is its army of armchair food critics and would-be cinephiles. Last week, everyone clutched their pearls over the show's return, proclaiming TV dead until its comeback like it’s the second coming of Breaking Bad. This week, they're melodramatically oscillating between treating it like a fine wine 🍷 they can’t start and an adrenaline shot they need to binge before a camping trip. Meanwhile, the forensic prop analysts are losing sleep over clock sightings 🕰️, and others are having existential crises mid-workout with NIN on repeat. Truly, the internet’s elite 🧠.
