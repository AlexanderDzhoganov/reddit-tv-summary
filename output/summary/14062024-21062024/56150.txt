**Interview with the Vampire**: The TV show that somehow convinced people that brooding, blood-sucking immortality is the new black. Last week's comments were a cult-like chant of "BEST SHOW EVER!" 🤩, while this week's literary essay on unreliable narrators 🤔 makes you wonder if the commenters are binge-watching or writing their dissertation. If the show is so mind-blowing, why does it feel like the viewers are trying to out-philosophize each other on Reddit? 🤷‍♂️ Season one was "tortured angsty love," and now we're diving into "Lestat's POV" while hallucinating in Dubai. Oh, the drama! 🎭
