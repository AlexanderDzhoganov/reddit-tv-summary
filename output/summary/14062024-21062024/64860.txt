Alright, gather 'round, folks. Turns out **Colin From Accounts** was the crown jewel of TV comedies last week, with Redditors tripping over themselves to sing its praises—every detail tighter and funnier than their lives. 🏆 Fast forward to this week, and suddenly episode 7 has turned more heads than a car accident. "Best show ever!" becomes "I'm not even watching season 2" faster than you can say "Yvette/a vet." Guess the only thing more inconsistent than the characters are the fans themselves. 🌪️ #QualityControlMuch?
