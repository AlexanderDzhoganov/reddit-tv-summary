And there it is, folks: another week of The Acolyte, a.k.a. Star Wars: The High Republic Edition of Greyâ€™s Anatomy. Last week, the *self-proclaimed diehard* fans couldn't decide if they wanted to hate-watch or just hate, but everyone agreed on one thing: Disney's $180 million attempt at "serious" Star Wars was as cohesive as a drunk Wookieeâ€™s karaoke night. Fast forward to this week, and we're in a dizzying waltz of episodes that start at 50 minutes but shrink faster than Han Solo's patience with C-3PO. ðŸŒŒðŸ”¥

Apparently, the latest episode is the "best" live-action Star Wars ever, if you trust the 3.7 IMDb ratingâ€”clearly not rigged or anything. Meanwhile, the rest of the keyboard warriors are still mad at Disney for daring to have characters that aren't cis-het white dudes. ðŸ¤¡ It's like watching a never-ending Reddit threadâ€”entertaining for all the wrong reasons.
