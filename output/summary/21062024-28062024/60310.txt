Oh look, "Presumed Innocent" is back to grace us with another snooze-fest of *paint-by-numbers* legal drama—because who doesn't love watching lawyers with sex problems hash out their midlife crises? 🎨💤 Commenters have gone from breathlessly praising the high-brow drama and *OMG* Ruth Negga, to whining about week-long waits between episodes like it's the end of civilization. The only thing more tedious than the contrived twists and "modern" updates is Peter Sarsgaard's attempt to hold this crumbling cookie together. 🍪 If last week was a love letter, this week is that crumpled breakup note you find in your locker.
