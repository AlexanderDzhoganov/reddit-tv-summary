Ah, *The Boys*, the TV show that went from "OMG, Antony Starr is a god!" 🤩 to "I'm hate-watching this trainwreck" 🚂💥 faster than Homelander can zap a civilian. Last week, everyone was too busy fangirling over Karl Urban and the show's "diabolical" antics to see the writing on the wall. Fast forward a week: now it's all filler, no killer 💤, and the commenters are lamenting their lost brain cells like they lost a Tinder match. The difference? Reality finally hit like a Vought PR disaster. 🌪️
