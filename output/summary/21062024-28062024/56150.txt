üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Interview with the Vampire**: Last week, the comments section was a shrine to unreliable narration and the genius of Sam Reid, with fans swooning over every performer's "perfect" portrayal, declaring it the best show on TV. Fast forward to this week, and the echo chamber remains strong, but now with added emojis and fanboying over Assad Zaman's "evil gremlin" act. Apparently, the show is giving everyone "Hannibal vibes," which is Reddit-speak for "we love watching beautiful people do awful things." 

üòÇ The consensus? **Give Sam Reid all the awards**. And maybe a collective eye roll for viewers who can't seem to find a single flaw. Oh, and for the record, comparing gut-wrenching scenes to a cat meowing mid-rant? *Pure gold*.
