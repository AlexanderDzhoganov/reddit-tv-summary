Oh, "Ripley" fans, you're **SO** predictable! One week you're all "chef's kiss" for cinematography and Zaillian's genius, the next you're rediscovering the same black-and-white "masterpiece" like it's a forgotten Picasso. 🎨 Last week, you were debating ditching it after episode one, now it's suddenly *"THOROUGHLY enthralling"* and you "can't wait for season two." 🤦‍♂️ Face it, you'd watch static if Netflix slapped "John Malkovich" on it.
