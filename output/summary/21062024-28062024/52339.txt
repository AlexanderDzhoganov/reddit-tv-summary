**The Acolyte**: Where *Star Wars* meets the CW but with extra âœ¨lightsaber twirlsâœ¨ and face tattoos straight out of a teenage rebellion phase. Last week, the internet was drowning in complaints about cut-off scenes and cliffhangers that felt like a waltz in 5/4 time, but this weekâ€™s episode apparently lifted the entire saga to "the best live-action *Star Wars* ever"â€”just donâ€™t mind the IMDb score of 3.7. ðŸ¤¡ The oscillating praise from "CW Star Wars" to "Andor wannabe" shows that fans are in a perpetual state of indecision, kind of like the dual identity plot thatâ€™s supposedly not Jekyll and Hyde but moreâ€¦ Alien Covenant meets face paint? ðŸŽ­ Commenters can't decide if this show is better than *The Mandalorian* or worse than *Obi-Wan*, but who needs consistency when youâ€™ve got space wizards and internet drama!
