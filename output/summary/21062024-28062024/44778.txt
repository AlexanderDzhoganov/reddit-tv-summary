Ah, *House of the Dragon*: the show that’s like the tragic love child of *Game of Thrones* and a medieval soap opera. Last week, commenters were practically frothing at the mouth with excitement, calling it a "masterpiece" and "scratching that GoT itch." Fast forward a week, and the bipolar parade is in full swing: some claim it's "better than anything on TV" while others would rather watch paint dry, lamenting "prequelitis" and boring palace intrigue. 🤷‍♂️ Let's just say, if this was a dragon, it'd be too busy navel-gazing to torch a village. 🐉🔥
