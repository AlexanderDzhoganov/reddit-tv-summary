🌑 **True Detective: Night Country** 🌑 – because who needs coherent storytelling when you can have Jodie Foster wandering through a moody wasteland of clichés? 🙄 Last week, everyone was hyped about the *"atmosphere"* and deeply invested in the *"exploration of characters"* (read: they hadn't watched it yet). This week? 🚮 The same folks are now wading through endless complaints about bad scripts, annoying characters, and a plot full of holes. The only mystery here is why anyone is still watching. Spoiler alert: the ending sucks. 👎🔍
