The Boys, or as some viewers call it, "The Spinners," seems to be losing its superpowers according to the commenters. From complaints of bloated episodes to predictable cliche plots and excessive gore, it appears the show is struggling to keep viewers hooked. With accusations of lackluster writing, aimless storytelling, and stagnant character development, it seems like even Homelander's facial twitches can't save this season from being labeled as a disappointment. 😏
