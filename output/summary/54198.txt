The comments range from begrudgingly poetic to outright exasperated. Fans are divided on whether the show's latest season was a slow burn or just plain filler. With complaints about overindulgent visuals, lack of character development, and an abundance of pointless scenes, it seems like even the most die-hard viewers are questioning the show's direction. In a season filled with fluff and unresolved plot threads, it's hard to tell if the show is serving up a delicious dish or just leaving viewers hungry for substance. 🍔📺
