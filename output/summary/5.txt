The commenters can't seem to agree if this show is a brooding masterpiece or a dumpster fire. Some found it boring and filled with bad dialogue, while others got lost in the "endless depression" and found it interesting. One viewer even thinks Jodie Foster couldn't save this mess. With complaints of shallow characters, silly plot lines, and a disappointing ending, it seems like this show might just be a "nothingburger" after all. But hey, at least one person thinks Season 1 is remarkable 🍿💔.
