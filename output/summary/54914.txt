The comments on this show about an aging comedian and her young protege are as predictable as the show's plotlines. Fans flip-flop between praising the chemistry of the leads and lamenting the lack of originality in the writing. It seems like viewers are stuck in a loop of disappointment, hoping for a fresh direction but getting served the same stale jokes season after season. Maybe it's time for the writers to take a hint from the commenters and inject some new life into this tired formula. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
