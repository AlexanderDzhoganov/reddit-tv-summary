The comment section on this show reads like a support group for those struggling with their inability to resist binging mediocre TV 🙄. From "pretty damn good" to "exciting and enjoyable," it seems like the bar for entertainment is set at "barely tolerable." But hey, at least Peter Sarsgaard is giving the performance of a lifetime, right? 🤷‍♂️
